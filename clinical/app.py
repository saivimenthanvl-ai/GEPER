───────────────
THE CLINICAL SERVICE'S APPLICATION OBJECT -- the thing that was missing.

`clinical/endpoints.py` has defined a router since before F1, and F1/F2 wired
its three routes to a real session and a request-scoped `DataAccess`. But
`include_router` appeared exactly once in the whole repository, inside
`clinical/tests/test_exception_endpoints_http.py`, where that file's own
docstring said the app was "test-local and deliberately so ... when the real
app lands, these tests should point at it instead". THIS IS THAT APP, and the
test file now points at it.

So the three routes were reachable only from a test. A router nobody mounts
is the same shape of defect as a placeholder nobody implements: every layer
looks present, and the service does not exist.

WHY THE READINESS ROUTE TOUCHES THE DATABASE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT
A service that boots and returns 500 on every request passes any liveness
probe. That is not hypothetical here -- it is exactly what this service would
have done before F1, when both dependencies raised `NotImplementedError`: the
process would have been up, `/healthz` would have answered 200, and every
real request would have been a 500. A readiness check that only proves the
process is alive measures something real and it is not the thing.

The precedent in this repository is the weaker kind: `kim_pipeline/api/main.py`
`/api/v1/ready` returns `{"status": "ready"}` unconditionally, touching
nothing it claims readiness for. `/readyz` here opens a connection and runs
real SQL, so an unreachable database, a missing DSN, or a database that is up
but was never bootstrapped all return 503 and name which one.

LIVENESS AND READINESS ARE KEPT APART BECAUSE THEY ANSWER TO DIFFERENT
ACTIONS. `/healthz` says "this process is running" -- if it fails, restart the
container. `/readyz` says "this service can do its job" -- if it fails, stop
sending it traffic, because restarting will not fix a database that is down.
Collapsing them means a database outage restart-loops every replica.

NO API-KEY LAYER, DELIBERATELY. `geper/api/main.py`'s `_require_api_key` is
the repository's ingress pattern and it is FAIL-OPEN by design: with
`GEPER_API_KEYS` unset it allows every request ("dev mode"). That is a
defensible trade for a structure-lookup API and it is the wrong default for
patient data. The clinical routes already authenticate per request through
`_get_session`, which fails CLOSED -- no session, no answer. Adding a
fail-open layer above a fail-closed one would only create a configuration in
which the outer check is off and looks on.
