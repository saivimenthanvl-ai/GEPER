───────────────────────────────

`fastq_sets`: the first unit of ingestion. One table, org-scoped by
construction, composite FK to `samples`, append-only, holding R1/R2 paths and
checksums, a detected timestamp and a state.

WHAT THIS FILE IS TESTING, STATED PLAINLY BECAUSE IT DECIDES WHETHER THE TESTS
MEAN ANYTHING. There is no scanner, no validation and no pipeline invocation in
this commit -- so the artefact under test IS THE SCHEMA, and the questions are
answered by asking the database to do something it must refuse. That is not the
Phase 5d trap in disguise: the 5d incident was tests that called
`db_session.execute()` INSTEAD OF the methods under test, so they verified the
database while the methods were broken. Here there are no methods yet. When
ingestion code lands, its own tests must go through it, and these stay as the
structural floor underneath.

THE ORG-SCOPING TRAP, WHICH MATTERS MORE THAN THE TABLE (Phase 5d, carded):
A PASSING ORG-SCOPING TEST IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SCOPING WORKING AND WITH THERE
BEING NO SCOPING AT ALL. A query with no org filter passes every single-org test
ever written. Only the CROSS-ORG case separates the two, so the org-scoping
tests here are all cross-org: org A's sample must be unreachable from org B, and
the assertion must fail if the mechanism is removed.

"ORG-SCOPED BY CONSTRUCTION" IS STRONGER THAN "ORG-SCOPED", and the composite FK
is what makes it structural rather than conventional: `fastq_sets` references
`samples (org_id, sample_id)`, not `samples (sample_id)`. An unscoped reference
is therefore NOT EXPRESSIBLE -- it is rejected by the database, not merely
absent from the code that was written. `TestAnUnscopedReferenceIsNotExpressible`
is the test of that claim, and `test_the_same_insert_succeeds_within_one_org` is
its positive control: a refusal test whose INSERT was malformed for some other
reason would pass while proving nothing.

APPEND-ONLY IS TESTED AS A PRIVILEGE, NOT AS A CONVENTION. A comment saying
"append-only" is not a control, and neither is application code that declines to
UPDATE. This file opens a REAL LOGIN CONNECTION as clinical_app -- the way
test_privilege_boundary.py does, and for the reason given there: every other
test file runs as superuser, which bypasses grants entirely -- and asserts the
exact exception class, proves the connection is live on the same table first,
and proves the refusal is capable of failing.
