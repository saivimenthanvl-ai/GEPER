────────────────────────────────────────────────
w139 — THE FOUR REMAINING w132 ITEMS, each with a stated verdict and the
evidence that decides it. Wave 5 of the overnight queue, at `863f07e`.

The four are not the same kind of thing, and the file is laid out so that a
reader can tell which is which without reading the code:

  (a) THE LOCKED-OUT BRANCH SPENT NO PASSWORD WORK.  **A REAL DEFECT, FIXED.**
      `login()` and `patient_login()` both returned from the locked-out branch
      without calling `_equalise_password_work`, so that branch was the ONE
      failure path in either method that spent no bcrypt at all. A locked
      address answered measurably faster than a wrong password against a live
      one, and only an address that EXISTS can be locked — so "cheap" confirmed
      the address, and an attacker can manufacture the state themselves with
      five wrong guesses. Two lines, one per method. §1.

  (b) `org_id` AS AN EXPLICIT LOGIN BODY FIELD.  **NOT A DEFECT.** It is load-
      bearing (an address is unique only WITHIN an organisation) and it is not
      an oracle in any of the three channels. §2 proves that rather than
      asserting it.

  (c) `Secure` COOKIE WITH NO TLS.  **NOT A CODE DEFECT — A DEPLOYMENT CARD.**
      The flag makes a plain-HTTP deployment fail CLOSED (the browser never
      sends the credential back), and removing it would be the defect. §3
      demonstrates the consequence through a spec cookie policy rather than
      asserting it from the source comment.

  (d) `POST /auth/logout` WAS IN NO REFUSAL-PARITY SET.  **A REAL COVERAGE GAP,
      CLOSED.** w138 F-3 / C-16: the patient half was closed by
      `test_w138_patient_portal_api.py`, the staff half was left to this wave.
      §4. Test-only; nothing about that route's behaviour changes.

AND ONE THING THAT WAS NOT ON THE LIST, FOUND WHILE ESTABLISHING (b) AND
REPORTED RATHER THAN FIXED — **C-17**. An anonymous caller reads the clinical
database's reachability off either login route by sending a MALFORMED BODY:
422 when the database is up, the generic 401 when it is unreachable or
unconfigured. It is the same shape as the w132 defect Rule 8 cites, in the one
channel w132 never probed, because every existing parity row sends a
well-formed body. It is NOT an `org_id` defect — a missing field or a non-object
body does it too — and closing it means a `RequestValidationError` handler on
`clinical/app.py`, which changes every route's answer and is a policy ruling
this wave was not given. `test_the_known_gap_*` in §2 is its tripwire, and its
docstring carries the whole finding.

WHY (a) IS TESTED BY COUNTING AND BY A STUB CLOCK AND NOT IN MILLISECONDS OF
REAL BCRYPT. `w132-http-auth-audit.md` §11 rules out "a test that MEASURES
login timing in milliseconds" as a flake on a shared runner, and a flaky
security test gets deleted. But "prove the change behaviourally, not by reading
the code" rules out an AST guard on its own. Both are satisfied by making the
work ITSELF observable: the hasher is a real object the method calls, so a
counting hasher observes what the method actually did at run time, and a
deliberately slow hasher makes the elapsed-time difference dominate everything
else in the request so the timing row measures the property and not the runner.
An AST row is included as well, but as the *third* line of defence and never
as the proof.

RULE 2a — THE METHOD, NOT A RAW QUERY. §1 and §2's bcrypt-count rows call
`DataAccess.login` / `DataAccess.patient_login`; §2's and §4's refusal rows go
through the real HTTP routes. Direct SQL appears only in fixtures that must
reach a state the clock cannot be asked for (a session past its window, a
disabled organisation). No assertion reads the database.

RULE 4 — EVERY ABSENCE AND EVERY SET HAS A POSITIVE TWIN. Each
`test_the_positive_twin_*` names, in its docstring, the wrong version it
catches and what it is vacuous against.

    Timing is the third, and the refusal-parity files cannot see it: a locked
    account and a wrong password already answered the identical
    `(401, {"detail": "Authentication failed."})` before this wave. What
    differed was the WORK, and the unit of the difference is a whole bcrypt

        so that closing it FAILS here and forces the closer to rewrite this row
        into the set-of-size-one form.

        THE FINDING (w139, carded C-17). An anonymous caller who sends a
        malformed BODY — not a malformed credential — reads the clinical
        database's reachability off the status code:

            database up          -> 422, with a pydantic error list
            database unreachable -> 401, the generic refusal
            DSN not configured   -> 401, the generic refusal

        That is the same shape as the w132 defect Rule 8 cites (the body is
        generic, the STATUS discriminates), surviving in the one channel w132
        never probed: every existing parity row sends a WELL-FORMED body, so
        the handler's dependencies always resolve and the 422 never appears.
        The cause is FastAPI's ordering — dependencies are solved before
        request-body validation errors are raised, so `_get_data_access`
        raises its 401 first whenever the database is not reachable.

        WHY IT IS NOT FIXED HERE. It is not an `org_id` defect: the same 401/422
        split appears for a MISSING field, for a wrong-typed `email`, and for a
        body that is not an object at all, on both login routes. Fixing it
        means a `RequestValidationError` handler on `clinical/app.py`, which
        changes the answer of EVERY route in the service and is a policy
        decision about whether honest clients keep their 422s. That is an
        app-level ruling of exactly the kind Wave 10 owns, it is not in Wave
        5's four items, and `clinical/app.py` installs no handlers or
        middleware at all today — a property its own structural guard pins.
        Inventing one to keep this wave tidy is the thing the queue forbids.

        Catches: nothing today. It is a REGRESSION TRIPWIRE, and the regression
        it watches for is somebody closing C-17 and leaving this document
        claiming the gap is open.

        dropping `org_id` from the lookup so the address alone identifies the
        principal.

        `shared@both.example` exists in Org A and Org B with DIFFERENT

        AT THE ROUTE IT IS INVISIBLE, AND THAT IS A PROPERTY WORTH KNOWING

        `auth_endpoints._refuse_uniformly` converts that failure into the same

# §3 — ITEM (c). `Secure` WITH NO TLS. VERDICT: NOT A CODE DEFECT.
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


class TestTheSecureCookieFailsClosedOverPlainHttp:
    """
    THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER.

    COUNTED at `863f07e`: nothing in this repository terminates TLS. The only
    two deployment shapes that exist are `clinical/Dockerfile` (ENTRYPOINT
    uvicorn, CMD `clinical.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`, with no
    `--ssl-certfile` / `--ssl-keyfile`) and the compose wiring held on
    `w125-clinical-service-up`, which publishes that same container's port 8000
    directly. There is no nginx, no ingress, no proxy of any kind in the tree.

    SO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS, per deployment shape:

      * BROWSER over `http://` — the `Secure` attribute means the cookie is
        never SENT back over a non-secure scheme. The login answers 204, the
        browser holds (or drops) the cookie, and the very next request arrives
        anonymous and is refused. The service is UNUSABLE and it fails CLOSED.
        Nothing leaks: the credential is never transmitted over cleartext.
      * BROWSER over `https://` (a TLS terminator someone adds outside this
        repository) — the cookie is returned and everything works. This is the
        intended shape.
      * NON-BROWSER CLIENT (curl without a cookie jar, the `geper/review`
        CLI, `TestClient`) — `Secure` is a browser instruction and a bare HTTP
        client ignores it entirely. These are unaffected either way, which is
        why the whole clinical test suite passes over plain HTTP.

    THEREFORE IT IS NOT A DEFECT IN THIS CODE. Removing `secure=True` would be
    the defect: it would make the plain-HTTP deployment WORK, by putting a full
    bearer credential on the wire in cleartext on every request. The flag is
    what stops that. What is missing is a TLS terminator, which is a deployment
    decision this repository does not express — Wave 10's territory, already
    carded in `w138`'s C-12 paragraph and in the `_set_session_cookie`
    docstring, which states the consequence in as many words.

    HOW THIS IS SHOWN. Not by re-reading that docstring: by handing the REAL
    `Set-Cookie` header the route emits to Python's `http.cookiejar`, which is
    an independent implementation of the cookie specification, and asking it
    what a client would do with it. The assertion is the standard library's
    answer, not mine.
