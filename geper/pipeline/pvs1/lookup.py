"""
TranscriptLookup: the facade `pipeline/orchestrator.py` talks to for the
transcript structure PVS1 needs, in the same shape as
`pipeline.clingen.lookup.ClinGenLookup` -- one `query_variant(variant,
assembly=..., gene_symbol=...)` call that returns a plain dict, never
raises, and is safe to call once per variant inside the main per-variant
loop.

Like ClinGen's, this lookup is *gene*-keyed rather than
coordinate-keyed: the structure fetched is a whole transcript, so a VCF
covering many variants in one gene pays the Ensembl round trip once.
The gene symbol itself is not resolved here -- the ClinGen stage already
resolves it (`pipeline/clingen/utils.py::resolve_gene_symbol`) and the
orchestrator passes it through, so a second identical Ensembl
gene-overlap call is avoided.

Source: Ensembl REST `lookup/symbol/{species}/{gene}?expand=1`, which
returns every transcript of the gene with its exon list and translation
block, and flags exactly one as `is_canonical`. That canonical
protein-coding transcript is the one used -- GENCODE's canonical
selection is MANE Select wherever a MANE transcript exists, which is the
transcript ACMG/AMP interpretation is normally performed against.

Layering: TranscriptLookup -> TranscriptCache -> Ensembl REST.
