clinical/tests/test_w135_patient_report_access.py
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
w135 — patient-safe report access, and the four things it refuses to hand over.

WHAT A RELEASED REPORT CONSISTS OF IN THIS MODEL, BECAUSE EVERY ROW BELOW
DEPENDS ON IT. `reports` has NO CONTENT COLUMN. Its columns are org_id, id,
interpretation_id, created_at, created_by, state, approver_id, approved_at,
content_hash, tombstoned_at, tombstoned_by, retention_days. A row there is a
governance record ABOUT a document, not the document. So "read my report"
resolves, in this schema and not in some other one, to METADATA AND RELEASE
STATE — the report exists, it belongs to this test, it was delivered on this
date — and the surface under test here is exactly that and nothing more. No
report-content storage was invented to make it larger; that refusal is the
deliverable.

WHAT CANNOT HAPPEN IN PRODUCTION, STATED BEFORE THE FIRST ASSERTION.
`_release_report` has ZERO non-test callers in this repository (counted at
d6246cd; the one grep hit is prose in geper/review/signoff.py). Nothing here
releases a report, so in THIS deployment `GET /portal/me/reports` returns `[]`
for every patient for ever. The released state is therefore constructed in
these tests the only legitimate way there is — by calling `_release_report`
itself, behind its own Approver gate, through the same fixture w134 uses — and
never by an UPDATE that forges `state = 'released'`. What is proved is that the
surface is correct when the state exists; what is NOT proved, and is not
claimed, is that any production path reaches it.

THE FOUR REFUSALS THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD IN PLACE:

  1. ANOTHER PATIENT'S REPORT — same organisation, real, released.
  2. ANOTHER ORGANISATION'S REPORT — the tenant axis, tested separately from
     the patient axis because they are separate axes.
  3. AN UNRELEASED REPORT OF THE CALLER'S OWN — draft, under_review, and
     approved-but-never-released. This is the one a reasonable implementer
     gets wrong: the report IS the patient's, and it is still not theirs to
     have. "Your report exists but you may not read it yet" is a clinical
     fact, and the release gate exists to withhold it.
  4. RAW RESULT DATA — `run_document`, reached through `get_interpretation`,
     which applies NO report-state check of any kind.

RULE 2a — THE ROUTE OR THE METHOD, NEVER A RAW SELECT. Every access claim
below is read back through `GET /portal/me/reports`, through
`GET /portal/me/reports/{report_id}`, or through
`DataAccess.list_my_released_reports` / `get_my_released_report`. Raw SQL
appears three times and only to SET UP: the `tests` catalogue row and the role
grants (as every existing fixture does), and `_tombstone`, which writes two
columns `clinical_app` is REVOKED from writing at all.

RULE 8 — AN ORACLE CAN LIVE IN EITHER CHANNEL. The refusal is asserted as a
SET OF SIZE ONE over `(status_code, response.content)` across TWELVE cases —
anonymous, malformed credential, unknown credential, the other principal's
valid session under each of the two cookie names, a nonexistent report, a
malformed report id, another patient's report, another organisation's report,
and the caller's own draft, under_review and approved reports — with the
positive twin proving the owner's own released report is NOT in that set and
carries its own real values.

RULE 4 — EVERY ABSENCE HAS A POSITIVE TWIN. "The body does not contain X" is
satisfied completely by a surface that returns nothing at all, and this surface
returns nothing at all in production. Every absence row here is paired.

RETRACTION — AND THE COUNT HAS MOVED SINCE THIS PARAGRAPH WAS FIRST WRITTEN.
It used to say `report_retractions` does not exist and a retracted report is
not constructible, and a row below asserted it. RE-COUNTED at 2de2fef:

  * `report_retractions` DOES exist in schema.sql — migration 0003 brought it
    across, and the measurement row fired exactly as designed.
  * `clinical/data_access.py` had no unapprove/retract/rescind method. THAT
    HALF MOVED AT w156 (WAVE 6) AND THE CLAIM IS FIXED RATHER THAN LEFT
    STANDING (Rule 3): `DataAccess.retract_report` now exists, is
    Approver-gated, and is reachable at
    `POST /admin/reports/{report_id}/retraction`. What has NOT moved is the
    rest of the sentence — there is still no unapprove and no rescind, and
    `enforce_content_immutability()` still FORBIDS walking an approved report
    back at the database, which is why retraction is a ROW and not a sixth
    `reports.state`.

So w148 implements the HUMAN'S DECISION 1: the report responses carry a simple
`is_retracted` boolean and nothing else — no reason, no retractor, no
timestamp, no `replacement_report_id`. Rulings E7 and E3 still point away from
hiding, so this surface still filters on RELEASE and never on retraction, and
`test_the_only_thing_that_hides_a_report_from_its_owner_is_release_state` — a
GUARD, re-authored in w148 and saying so in its own docstring — still holds
that shape in place.

AND THE RETRACTION ROWS IN §8 ARRANGE THEIR STATE BY DIRECT INSERT, which is
the ONE addition to the Rule-2a paragraph above. `_retract` explains why that
is arrangement and not the bypass pattern: the subject of every one of those
rows is a READER, and every expectation is still read back through the route.

        THE FORWARD-SAFE SHAPE, PINNED. w122's ruling E7 is explicit that a
        retracted report must not become UNFINDABLE, and E3 that retraction
        does not refuse at the release gate -- the retraction travels with the
        document instead. So the correct predicate on this surface is release,
        and only release.

        ─── THIS IS A GUARD AND w148 RE-AUTHORED IT. SAID PLAINLY. ───

        WHAT IT PROTECTED: that retraction cannot decide WHICH ROWS COME BACK
        from `_MY_RELEASED_REPORTS_SQL`. Its own docstring named the failure it
        was written for, in these words: "a later implementer adding `AND NOT
        EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM report_retractions ...)` or a tombstone filter to
        this query". That is a FILTER. The old text spelled the property as
        `"retract" not in shared.lower()`, which was an exact statement of it
        only for as long as retraction could not legitimately appear in the
        statement at all.

        WHY IT COULD NOT STAY LITERAL: the human's decision 1 requires the
        flag on this surface, and two other standing rows require it to be
        derived in THIS statement -- `test_the_two_methods_share_one_sql_text`
        pins this constant's caller count at exactly four, and
        test_patient_identity.py's
        `test_every_portal_statement_binds_the_patient_from_the_session`
        requires every statement a portal method issues to bind the session's
        patient. A second statement breaks both. So the word now appears in
        this text, once, in the projection.

        THE PROPERTY STILL HOLDS, AND IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. The statement
        is split at its own `FROM` and the word is required to be present in
        the select list and ABSENT from everything after it -- every JOIN,
        every LATERAL, and the WHERE. A projection is evaluated per row that
        the FROM/WHERE has already chosen: it can neither add a row nor remove
        one. That is the same property, stated where it is still true, and on
        one half it is STRICTLY STRONGER than the old text, which was
        satisfied by deleting the constant outright and is now paired with a
        positive assertion that the derivation exists.

        THE BEHAVIOURAL PROOF is `TestTheRetractedReportIsShownAndFlagged`
        below: a really-retracted, really-released report is asserted to be
        STILL IN THE LIST and still readable by id. A filter re-introduced

class TestTheRetractedReportIsShownAndFlagged:
    """
    THE HUMAN'S DECISION, IMPLEMENTED (w148, PHASE 2): "Patient-facing report
    responses must expose a simple retraction status/flag. Do NOT expose
    internal retraction reasons, internal review details, or
    `replacement_report_id`."

    THIS CLASS REPLACES THE MEASUREMENT THAT USED TO STAND HERE. Until 2de2fef
    `report_retractions` did not exist and a row here asserted its absence,
    naming what its arrival would owe: "decide what the PATIENT sees and
    revisit w135." The table arrived; the decision was made; the rows below are
    the positive form of the same obligation. An absence row is satisfied by
    the broken state (Rule 4), so every row here asserts CONTENT -- the value
    of the flag on a real, released, really-retracted report -- and not merely
    that something appeared.

    HOW A RETRACTION IS CREATED HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE BYPASS PATTERN: see
    `_retract` above. The subject of every row in this class is a READER.
