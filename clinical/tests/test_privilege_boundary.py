tests/test_privilege_boundary.py
────────────────────────────────

Does schema.sql's GRANT/REVOKE block actually enforce what it says?

EVERY OTHER FILE IN clinical/tests/ RUNS OVER THE SUPERUSER CONNECTION, which
bypasses grants entirely, and creates the roles without LOGIN purely so
schema.sql's GRANT statements have something to name. Meredith wrote that
limitation into test_phase_7_commit4_retention.py's own docstring rather than
letting it be found later. This file closes it: it opens REAL LOGIN
CONNECTIONS as clinical_app and clinical_retention and asks the database.

WHY THIS BOUNDARY AND NOT ANOTHER. D0(c) was ruled specifically to make
deletion a DATABASE-ENFORCED fact rather than an application convention --
"clinical_app's REVOKE stays ABSOLUTE -- the application still cannot delete,
which is what every claim rests on." Several ISO claims rest on that sentence
being true of the database rather than true of the code that talks to it. Until
this file existed, a typo in the GRANT block, or a REVOKE that silently failed
to apply, would have passed all 340 tests.

HOW THIS FILE AVOIDS PASSING FOR THE WRONG REASON. A permission test that
passes because the connection was dead, the table name was misspelled, or the
assertion caught the wrong exception is indistinguishable from one that passes
because the privilege system works. Three guards, and they are the substance of
the file rather than decoration:

  1. THE EXACT EXCEPTION CLASS. Every refusal asserts
     psycopg.errors.InsufficientPrivilege. Catching bare Exception would pass on
     a typo'd table, a closed connection, or a syntax error -- it would assert
     only that SOMETHING went wrong, which is what a broken test also observes.

  2. THE CONNECTION IS PROVEN LIVE ON THE SAME TABLE it is refused on
     (TestTheConnectionsAreRealAndWorking). A role that cannot do ANYTHING
     passes every refusal test in this file. So each role first demonstrates a
     permission it does hold, against the same object, before its refusals mean
     anything.

  3. THE REFUSAL IS PROVEN CAPABLE OF FAILING
     (TestTheRefusalAssertionCanItselfFail). The grant is temporarily widened,
     the same statement is observed to SUCCEED, and the grant is put back and
     the refusal observed to return. A negative assertion that has only ever
     been seen passing is evidence of nothing; this makes the known-positive
     permanent and re-runnable instead of a one-off observation by whoever
     wrote it.

THIS FILE TESTS THE GRANT BLOCK. IT DOES NOT ADJUST IT. If an assertion here
fails, the finding is that the privilege boundary is not what the schema claims
-- which is a finding to report, not a test to soften.
