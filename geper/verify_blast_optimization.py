# *** THE VERDICT BELOW IS UNDATED. ***
#
# WHAT THIS IS, in its own words: Verification harness for the BLAST performance optimization (Phase 3
#
# NOTHING RE-RUNS THIS FILE. Measured 2026-09-11 across the 17 files matching
# geper/verify_*.py, geper/benchmark_*.py and dry_run_harness.py: ZERO are
# referenced in .github/workflows, and pytest does not collect any of them,
# because they are not named test_*. So whatever this script printed, it
# printed on the day somebody ran it by hand -- AND WHICH DAY THAT WAS IS
# RECORDED NOWHERE. `git log` on this file gives the date it was EDITED,
# which is a different fact and must not be quoted as if it were this one.
#
# WHY THE NOTE RATHER THAN A FIX: the file is not broken. Its stubs are
# honest -- it fakes everything EXCEPT the thing it verifies, and it
# propagates its exit code -- and all 59 stub targets across these harnesses
# were still defined when this was written, so they can all still be applied.
# The risk is CITATION: 'verify' is in the filename, which invites someone to
# quote this file's green as evidence. That is the `docker history` shape --
# something that reads as a record and is not one.
#
# IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO CITE THIS FILE: run it, and say when you ran it.

"""
Verification harness for the BLAST performance optimization (Phase 3
performance pass): in-memory + on-disk caching, concurrent batch
submission, mode="auto" local-database preference, and AI-only mode.

WHAT'S BEING VERIFIED
-----------------------
1. In-memory + disk caching: an identical sequence BLASTed twice
   (same run, or a fresh BLASTClient instance pointed at the same
   cache directory -- simulating a second run / a resumed run) only
   ever triggers ONE real search call, and every cache hit returns a
   byte-for-byte identical result to the real search.
2. Cross-run persistence: a brand-new BLASTClient instance (no shared
   in-memory state) still gets a cache hit from a previous instance's
   disk cache.
3. Concurrent batch submission: `search_many()` for N distinct
   sequences overlaps their (simulated) NCBI queue wait instead of
   paying it serially -- wall-clock time for N sequences is close to
   one sequence's latency (bounded by max_concurrent), not N times it.
4. mode="auto": resolves to "local" when a blastn binary + database
   files are present, and to "remote" otherwise -- and a local search
   never touches the (mocked) remote path at all.
5. AI-only mode (disabled=True): search()/search_many() never call
   the real remote/local implementation and return an explicit
   "skipped" result immediately.
6. Correctness invariant: none of the above changes a single BLAST
   hit/score/e-value versus the original unbatched, uncached call --
   only how many times / how quickly it's computed.

WHY A MOCK BLAST LAYER
------------------------
This sandbox's outbound network doesn't reach NCBI (only package
registries are allowlisted). Only the network-touching internals
(`BLASTClient._search_remote` / `subprocess.run` for local) are
replaced with small, deterministic fakes that simulate NCBI's real
queue latency with `time.sleep`; every other line of real GEPER code
(caching, batching, mode resolution, disabled short-circuiting) runs
unmodified.
