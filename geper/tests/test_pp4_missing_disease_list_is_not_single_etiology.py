Card: pp4-treats-a-missing-disease-list-as-a-satisfied-single-etiology.

PP4 requires BOTH halves of "the patient's phenotype is highly specific
for a disease with a single genetic etiology":

    specific_enough = overlap_ratio >= cfg.PP4_OVERLAP_THRESHOLD
    single_etiology = len(distinct_diseases) <= cfg.PP4_MAX_DISTINCT_DISEASES
    if specific_enough and single_etiology:   -> PP4 triggered

and built the second half's input like this:

    distinct_diseases = hpo_result.get("distinct_disease_ids") or []

A MISSING key becomes `[]`, and `len([]) <= N` is True, so "we do not
know how many diseases this gene is curated against" was resolved into
the affirmative condition PP4 needs. The direction of failure is toward
FIRING a pathogenic-supporting rule -- the opposite of the convention
this codebase states in its own words at
`kim_pipeline/pipeline/orchestration/shared.py`: "absence must not read
as a confirmed favorable result."

WHAT KEPT THIS FROM BEING A LIVE BUG, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A DEFENCE

Every producer that reaches `_pp4` with `found=True` goes through
`HPOGeneEvidence.to_dict()` (hpo/models.py:112), which always emits the
key; the shapes that omit it -- `HPOLookup.query_variant`'s early
returns and `_run_hpo_stage`'s exception path -- all carry `found=False`
and are filtered by the guard above. So the affirmative branch cannot be
reached from today's callers, and this file's dangerous cases build the
shape by hand.

That makes this latent, not live, and it is graded on the direction of
failure rather than on today's reachability: the safety of an
affirmative clinical claim rests entirely on a sibling module continuing
to emit a key it is under no contract to emit. Correctness that depends
on a distant collaborator's current habit is a coincidence, not a guard.

The same line one above is the counter-example that makes the point:

    gene_terms = {... for t in (hpo_result.get("distinct_phenotype_terms") or [])}

identical shape, and it fails SAFE -- an empty term set drives
overlap_ratio to 0, `specific_enough` is False, and PP4 cannot fire. Two
lines, one apart, same idiom, opposite failure directions, and nothing
at the call site tells you which is which.

SCOPE -- WHAT THIS FILE LEFT OPEN, AND HOW IT WAS CLOSED

`distinct_disease_ids: []` PRESENT is a measurement: HPO was consulted
and this gene has no curated disease entries. Whether a gene with zero
curated diseases should satisfy "a single genetic etiology" is a
SEMANTIC question about the rule, not a truthiness bug, so when this
file first landed only the UNKNOWN case moved and the empty list was
PINNED BELOW UNCHANGED, flagged for a separate ruling.

*** THAT RULING ARRIVED (2026-08-28): IT DOES NOT SATISFY IT. *** A gene
with no curated diseases has not answered the single-etiology question
either way, so it cannot meet the condition; `len([]) <= threshold`
resolving to True was the empty-means-satisfied collapse. Both states
now return not_evaluated, and they are required to give DIFFERENT
rationales, because "nobody told us" and "we asked, and the answer is
zero" are different facts.

The control below has therefore been INVERTED rather than deleted. It
was the written answer the ruling was made against, and keeping it --
now asserting the opposite -- is what makes the change legible to
whoever reads this file next.
