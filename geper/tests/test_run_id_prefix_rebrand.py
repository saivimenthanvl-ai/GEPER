"""
FIX #13 (already ruled -- executing the rename only): the fallback run-ID
prefix `report/summary.py::_derive_run_id` generates changes from
"GEPER-RUN-" to "BIJ-RUN-", matching the "Bij AI" branding then used
elsewhere in generated reports. (That branding rationale has since been
superseded for the report titles themselves: wave 116 ruled that a title
saying which component produced the report names the component, so
`summary_short.py`'s title is now "GEPER Clinical Genomic Summary
Report". The run-ID prefix itself was ruled separately and is unchanged.)

This is the only LIVE producer of the prefix -- confirmed by grep across
geper/ before touching anything: every other "GEPER-RUN-..." occurrence
in this codebase is a historical, already-generated example ID quoted in
a test docstring or fixture (a real run's actual recorded ID, e.g.
`GEPER-RUN-20260813` in tests/fixtures/offline_evidence/), not a second
place the prefix is constructed -- renaming the constant here does not
and should not change those, since they document what a specific past
run was actually called.
