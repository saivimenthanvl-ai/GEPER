"""
reports.state is a CONTROL, and this file is what checks it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. D0b's content-immutability trigger deliberately does not
police state: its own comment says it "only ever asks did content change, never
is this transition legal". That is a sound division of labour, but it leaves
`state` writable on an approved report -- measured, on a live database, as
clinical_app AND as the superuser:

    UPDATE reports SET state = 'draft'   on an APPROVED report   ->  PERMITTED

THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE, AND THIS FILE IS WHY. The residual was audited rather
than recorded; the audit established that state GATES DELIVERY and is therefore
a control; and the mechanism ruling was then revised so the trigger refuses a
walk-back outright. The paragraph above describes the world this file was written
in, kept because it is the reason the file exists.

WHAT CHANGED HERE WHEN THE GAP CLOSED. Fifteen of the original twenty tests went
red, which is not a defect in either piece of work: a walk-back on an approved
report was this file's shared SETUP, not just one test's subject. Fourteen tests
used it to construct an "approved then corrupted" report so they could assert
something about the gate, retrieval or blast radius. Prevention deleted the
executable evidence those tests were standing on.

The line that decided each one: IF THE TEST'S SUBJECT WAS THE GAP, it is retired
or inverted. IF THE TEST MERELY USED THE GAP AS A MECHANISM to reach a subject
about something else -- the gate, retrieval -- it is rewritten to construct the
state directly. That is not a loophole around this file's own fixture rule. The
rule is that a fixture must not use THE MECHANISM THE TEST MEASURES; those tests
measure the gate and retrieval, and a report CREATED in draft, under_review or
returned is a genuine report in that state rather than one pushed there.

THE AUDIT'S ANSWER: it does. require_release() -- "the one gate every delivery
path calls" -- refuses any report whose state is not approved or released, and
create_amendment() refuses on the same basis. Both were already tested for a
report that was NEVER approved (draft, under_review). NEITHER was tested for a
report that WAS approved and is then walked BACK, which is the case the residual
is actually about, and the case where the consequence is not "delivery correctly
refused" but "an approved report effectively WITHDRAWN from the record" -- ISO
15189 7.4.1.8 from the other direction, reached without touching one content
column.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
  It LOCKS the filtering, because the filtering is the control: if a future
  change dropped the state check, unapproved reports would leave the platform,
  which is worse than the residual itself.
  It also BOUNDS THE BLAST RADIUS by measuring what a walk-back does NOT destroy
  -- the report stays retrievable and the release record survives, because
  release_events is append-only. Those are real mitigations and they should be
  held in place by a test rather than remembered.
  It never asserted that a walk-back was acceptable, and that is the whole reason
  this transition could be closed by editing the mechanism rather than by
  arguing with a test. A test that exists to document a gap should FAIL when the
  gap closes. These did, loudly, and the inverted premise test below now asserts
  the refusal instead.

# ─── HUMAN RULING E10 (w122): the enumeration that catches a forgetful reader ─
#
# THE RESIDUAL THIS ANSWERS, STATED HONESTLY BECAUSE IT IS REAL. Under the
# approved retraction model (model 3) the retraction lives in its own table
# beside the report, and NOTHING IN THE DATABASE stops a reader that checks
# `reports.state` and forgets to check for a retraction. The trigger cannot
# help -- there is no row to refuse. The grant cannot help -- reading is
# permitted. A sixth state would have refused a retracted report in every
# existing reader for free, and would have bought that by rewriting a row that
# says a report was approved into one that says it was not.
#
# The human accepted that trade on the condition that the forgetfulness is
# DETECTED. This is the detector, and its design matters more than its
# existence: an enumeration that pinned the CURRENT SET of composing methods
# would pass happily while a new reader forgot. What is pinned instead is the
# RELATIONSHIP -- "gates on the delivery states" implies "composes retraction"
# -- so a method written tomorrow is measured by the same rule.
#
# HOW A "READER" IS IDENTIFIED, and why this shape rather than a grep. It is
# a method defined directly in class DataAccess, in this one file, whose body
# contains an ==, !=, in or not in comparison that NAMES AT LEAST ONE DELIVERY
# STATE as a string constant. The name may appear directly ('approved'), inside
# a literal tuple/list/set, or through a module-level constant bound to such a
# literal. That is the whole rule, and it is deliberately one rule rather than
# a shape per call site.
#
# WHAT THE RULE USED TO BE, AND WHY IT WAS WIDENED (w123). It used to demand
# all three of: an @auditable CALL decorator, a containment operator, and a
# literal sequence holding BOTH states. Measured against a4907d3 with three
# mutant readers inserted into DataAccess, only one of the three was caught:
#   decorated   + `if state in ('approved', 'released')`   CAUGHT
#   decorated   + `if state == 'released'`                 MISSED -- 21 passed
#   undecorated + `if state in ('approved', 'released')`   MISSED -- 21 passed
# Dropping the decorator requirement and admitting equality against a single
# delivery state catches all three. The decorator requirement was the weakest
# of the three anyway: it asserted a convention (every entry point is audited)
# as if it were the definition of a reader, so the cheapest way to escape the
# detector was to write the gate in a helper -- which is where gates normally
# end up.
#
# NEGATION FORMS, AND THE ONE THAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MATCHED.
#   INCLUDED: `not in ('approved', 'released')` and `!= 'released'`. Those are
#   the canonical shapes in this file -- require_release, retract_report and
#   create_amendment all raise on `state not in (...)`, and _release_report
#   tests `state != 'released'`. A decision taken BY NEGATING a delivery state
#   is still a decision taken on the delivery states.
#   NOT INCLUDED: the complement over NON-delivery states -- `!= 'draft'`,
#   `not in ('draft', 'under_review', 'returned')`. It admits the delivery
#   states by omission, so on paper it is a delivery gate too. In practice it
#   is the shape of every ordinary workflow precondition: place_order tests
#   `orders.state != 'draft'` and has nothing to do with reports at all;
#   submit_for_review and _approve_report gate on ENTRY to the workflow, not on
#   EXIT to a consumer. Matching it would pull three unrelated methods in and
#   each would need an exemption, and a detector that hands out exemptions to
#   stay quiet is how this guarantee dies. It is listed as a blind spot on the
#   test below rather than silently dropped.
#
# HOW COMPOSITION IS IDENTIFIED: the method calls `self._read_retraction_row`,
# the one place retraction is read from the database. Routing every composer
# through one helper is what makes this question mechanical instead of
# textual. Note what this does and does not establish: it proves the QUESTION
# WAS ASKED, not that the answer was used.

def test_every_delivery_state_gate_composes_retraction():
    """
    THE RELATIONSHIP, not the roster -- within one file, over one shape.

    WHAT IT ENFORCES, EXACTLY. Every method defined directly in class
    DataAccess in clinical/data_access.py whose PYTHON SOURCE contains an
    ==, !=, in or not in comparison naming 'approved' or 'released' as a
    string constant (bare, in a literal sequence, or via a module-level
    constant bound to one) must also call self._read_retraction_row, or be
    named in RETRACTION_COMPOSITION_EXEMPT with a reason.

    WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. This is an AST walk over one Python file, and the
    blind spots are not hypothetical -- the first one is a shape this very
    codebase uses on every query:

      1. SQL STRING GATES, and this is permanent. A gate written as
         `WHERE state IN ('approved', 'released')` -- or `state = 'approved'`,
         or pushed down into a view, a stored function or a trigger -- is a
         string constant to Python. An AST walk sees a str, not a comparison,
         and no amount of widening changes that without becoming a grep over
         SQL text. A delivery path that filters in the database and never
         mentions a state in Python passes this test while forgetting
         retraction entirely.
      2. INDIRECTION IN THE STATE NAME. An enum member (ReportState.APPROVED),
         an f-string, a locally-assigned variable, a value read from another
         row, a set built by a call -- none resolve here. Only bare constants,
         literal sequences and module-level constants bound to literals do.
      3. ANYTHING OUTSIDE DataAccess. Gates in geper/api routes, in
         submission_worker, in a renderer, or in a subclass or mixin, are not
         walked. Only methods in this one class body in this one file are.
      4. COMPOSITION IS A CALL, NOT A USE. Matching self._read_retraction_row
         proves the question was ASKED. A method that calls it and throws the
         answer away passes. Nothing here checks what the caller does with a
         retraction it found.
      5. THE COMPLEMENT FORM IS NOT MATCHED ON PURPOSE. `state != 'draft'`
         admits the delivery states by omission and is not treated as a
         delivery gate; see the block comment above for why, and for the three
         methods that would otherwise have needed exemptions.

    So: this catches a forgetful reader that decides in Python, in this class,
    by naming a delivery state. That is narrower than "a reader added
    tomorrow", which is what this docstring used to claim. The residual is
    real and the human accepted it against model 3; an overclaim here is worse
    than the narrower guarantee honestly described, because the overclaim is
    what gets quoted into a decision.
