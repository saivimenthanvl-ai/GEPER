"""
reports.state is a CONTROL, and this file is what checks it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. D0b's content-immutability trigger deliberately does not
police state: its own comment says it "only ever asks did content change, never
is this transition legal". That is a sound division of labour, but it leaves
`state` writable on an approved report -- measured, on a live database, as
clinical_app AND as the superuser:

    UPDATE reports SET state = 'draft'   on an APPROVED report   ->  PERMITTED

THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE, AND THIS FILE IS WHY. The residual was audited rather
than recorded; the audit established that state GATES DELIVERY and is therefore
a control; and the mechanism ruling was then revised so the trigger refuses a
walk-back outright. The paragraph above describes the world this file was written
in, kept because it is the reason the file exists.

WHAT CHANGED HERE WHEN THE GAP CLOSED. Fifteen of the original twenty tests went
red, which is not a defect in either piece of work: a walk-back on an approved
report was this file's shared SETUP, not just one test's subject. Fourteen tests
used it to construct an "approved then corrupted" report so they could assert
something about the gate, retrieval or blast radius. Prevention deleted the
executable evidence those tests were standing on.

The line that decided each one: IF THE TEST'S SUBJECT WAS THE GAP, it is retired
or inverted. IF THE TEST MERELY USED THE GAP AS A MECHANISM to reach a subject
about something else -- the gate, retrieval -- it is rewritten to construct the
state directly. That is not a loophole around this file's own fixture rule. The
rule is that a fixture must not use THE MECHANISM THE TEST MEASURES; those tests
measure the gate and retrieval, and a report CREATED in draft, under_review or
returned is a genuine report in that state rather than one pushed there.

THE AUDIT'S ANSWER: it does. require_release() -- "the one gate every delivery
path calls" -- refuses any report whose state is not approved or released, and
create_amendment() refuses on the same basis. Both were already tested for a
report that was NEVER approved (draft, under_review). NEITHER was tested for a
report that WAS approved and is then walked BACK, which is the case the residual
is actually about, and the case where the consequence is not "delivery correctly
refused" but "an approved report effectively WITHDRAWN from the record" -- ISO
15189 7.4.1.8 from the other direction, reached without touching one content
column.

WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
  It LOCKS the filtering, because the filtering is the control: if a future
  change dropped the state check, unapproved reports would leave the platform,
  which is worse than the residual itself.
  It also BOUNDS THE BLAST RADIUS by measuring what a walk-back does NOT destroy
  -- the report stays retrievable and the release record survives, because
  release_events is append-only. Those are real mitigations and they should be
  held in place by a test rather than remembered.
  It never asserted that a walk-back was acceptable, and that is the whole reason
  this transition could be closed by editing the mechanism rather than by
  arguing with a test. A test that exists to document a gap should FAIL when the
  gap closes. These did, loudly, and the inverted premise test below now asserts
  the refusal instead.
