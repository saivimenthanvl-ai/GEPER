────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 7 commit 1: hash scope corrected, verify_report_integrity, lineage FK.

This corrects a Phase 6 decision. _approve_report's content_hash originally
covered run_document only; reviewer_claims were excluded on the reasoning that
spec 13.2 leaves WHICH CLAIMS A RELEASED REPORT DISPLAYS as an undecided
expert-branch question, and hashing them felt like fixing undecided rendering
into an immutability check early.

That conflated two questions. Which claims are DISPLAYED is rendering, and the
expert branch still governs that, undisturbed by this commit. Which claims
EXISTED AT APPROVAL is a fact about what was approved, fixed the moment an
Approver signs. The hash now covers the second question: run_document AND the
full set of reviewer_claims against it, as stored -- not as any surface later
renders them.

TestVerifyReportIntegrityDetectsTampering is the test the commit exists to
prove: a reviewer_claims row edited after approval, via a direct database
write that bypasses the application layer entirely (reviewer_claims is
append-only against clinical_app itself -- see schema.sql's REVOKE UPDATE --
so this is exactly the class of tampering a content hash exists to catch,
not a channel the application would ever open on its own). Before this
commit, nothing detected it: the old hash never covered reviewer_claims at
all, so a mutated claim and an unmutated one hashed identically upstream of
that gap. This test's purpose is to fail against the OLD hash scope and pass
against the new one.
