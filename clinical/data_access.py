Clinical platform, Phase 1: the identity data-access layer.

HOW ORGANISATION ISOLATION IS ENFORCED, stated exactly, because the honest
version is narrower than "the type system prevents it":

Python has no compile-time check. What this module provides instead is
enforcement BY CONSTRUCTION:

  1. Every method that reads or writes org-scoped data takes a `Session` as
     its first argument, and the organisation comes from that session --
     never from a caller-supplied parameter. There is no signature into which
     a caller can pass an organisation of their choosing.
  2. Every SQL statement against an org-scoped table carries `org_id = %s`
     bound from the session. Not one is optional.
  3. There is NO raw-query path. The connection is private, no method returns
     it, and no method accepts SQL. A caller who wants a query that skips the
     org predicate has to edit this file.
  4. `tests/test_identity.py::TestStructuralIsolation` fails if one is
     introduced -- it parses this module and asserts that every SELECT/UPDATE
     touching an org-scoped table mentions org_id, and that no public method
     exposes the connection.

The schema carries the other half: composite foreign keys on
(user_id, org_id) mean a role assignment, session, or backup code cannot
reference a user in another organisation even if this layer were wrong. See
schema.sql.

CLOCK INJECTION. Nothing in this module calls `datetime.now()`. Every time
value comes from `self._clock.now()`. This is not a testing convenience: a
lockout test that advances a mock clock while production code reads the wall
clock compares two different clocks and then passes or fails for reasons
unrelated to the behaviour under test. One clock, injected, all the way
through.

    human ruling requiring it -- a future bug, a race, or a raw-SQL bypass

    Refusing keeps the failure inside the lab, where the remedy is one
    administrator call (set_clinician_identity) against an account that should
    have carried these fields before it was ever given the Approver role.

    Deliberately NOT raised by _approve_report. Approval behaviour is

    Decorator that wraps a DataAccess method to capture audit outcomes.

    action: str, dict, or callable that resolves to action name.
        - str: single action name used for all outcomes.
        - dict: maps outcome ('success', 'denied', 'error') to action name.
              Enables methods like login() that have different actions per outcome.
        - callable(params, result): returns action name based on parameters/result.
              Enables methods like set_user_disabled() where action depends on parameter.

    resource_type: the resource type being acted upon.

    requires_session: whether the method takes a Session as first argument.

    auditable: whether this method should be audited.
        False: marks this as a deliberate read/non-auditable operation.

    details_builder: callable(bound_params, result) returning audit details dict.
        bound_params: dict of resolved method parameters (positional/keyword resolved).
        result: return value of the method (None on failure).

    reason: explanation for non-auditable methods or special cases.

    resource_id_param: name of the method PARAMETER that identifies the resource
        this entry is about. Default None keeps the original behaviour -- the
        audit row's resource_id comes from the method's RETURN VALUE, which is
        right for the creators (create_report returns the report id) and only
        for them.

        THE DEFECT THIS PARAMETER EXISTS FOR (w120). A method declared `-> None`
        returns no identifier ever, so `str(result) if result else "<none>"`
        recorded '<none>' every time. _approve_report is one of those, and its
        entry -- action='report_approved', resource_type='report' -- therefore
        said a report had been approved without saying WHICH, for the single
        event that makes a report releasable (spec 13.3). `-> bool`
        verify_report_integrity was wrong in the direction that matters most: a
        MATCH recorded the string 'True', and a MISMATCH -- the nonconformance
        ISO 15189 7.5 wants findable -- recorded '<none>', because False is
        falsy.

        A method that cannot return an identifier must therefore say where its
        identifier comes from. Enforced structurally by
        clinical/tests/test_w120_audit_resource_id.py, whose
        test_every_auditable_method_that_cannot_return_an_id_declares_where_its_id_comes_from
        fails any auditable `-> None`/`-> bool` method that neither declares
        this nor appears on that test's reasoned exemption list.

        SUCCESS PATH ONLY. Denied and errored outcomes keep their existing
        '<denied>'/'<error>' markers: what those rows should record is a
        separate question, and widening it here would be a redesign rather

# DECORATOR IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (Phase 2 audit layer):
# Methods with side-by-side equivalence proof (old _audit() vs @auditable):
#  - create_organisation (Method 1): PROVEN ✓
#  - create_user (Method 2): PROVEN ✓ (fixed email extraction via signature binding)
#  - terminate_session (Method 3): PROVEN ✓
#  - assign_role (Method 4): PROVEN ✓
#
# Methods decorated without side-by-side proof (equivalence inferred from test coverage):
#  - log_failed_login (Method 5): UNPROVEN (test suite validates behavior)
#  - login (Method 6): UNPROVEN (test suite validates behavior)
#  - set_user_disabled (Method 7): UNPROVEN (test suite validates behavior)
#  - enrol_totp (Method 8): UNPROVEN (test suite validates behavior)
#  - session_valid (Method 9): MARKED NON-AUDITABLE (validation read, not a resource action)
#
# NOTE: Methods 1–4 found bugs (org_id=None, email=None) that passing tests had missed.
# Methods 5–9 removed old calls unproven; this is a recorded gap, not validation.

        Spec 15.3: "Re-analysis produces a new interpretation, a new report,
        and a new lineage branch from the same VCF. It does not update the
        old one." This creates the new interpretation only; call
        create_report() with the returned id exactly as for a fresh
        interpretation -- the two-call pattern is unchanged, only the source
        of the interpretation differs.

        Human ruling 1 (who may trigger): same act as create_interpretation,
        with a different trigger -- create_interpretation has no explicit
        role gate today, so this does not add one either. Widening either
        method's gating is a separate decision, not this commit's.

        Human ruling 2 (predecessor state): not gated on the parent's report
        state. 15.3 re-interprets the VCF, not the report -- a draft or
        under-review report on the parent must not block new evidence being
        applied to the underlying data. No report-state query appears here.

        Human ruling 3 (branching): parent_interpretation_id is the caller's
        explicit claim, never derived as "the current tip" of anything --
        A->B and A->C are both valid, and so is re-branching from B after C
        exists. The only validation is that the named parent exists, is in
        this org, and belongs to the named vcf_id -- so a caller who passes
        a parent from a different VCF is refused rather than silently
        re-analysing the wrong data.

        submission_key: interpretations.submission_key is UNIQUE per org
        (Phase 4a idempotency for original submissions). Reusing that
        formula (content_hash|platform_sample_id) here would make every
        re-analysis of the same VCF collide with the original AND with each
        other, which directly contradicts ruling 3's "A->B and A->C both
        valid". A re-analysis is a deliberate new act, not a resubmission,
        so it gets a key that is unconditionally unique per call instead of
        idempotent on content.

        Record one completed pipeline run: a sequencing run for the sample,
        the VCF it analysed, the interpretation (its run_document), and a
        draft report on that interpretation -- ALL OR NOTHING.

        WHY THIS DOES NOT CALL create_sequencing_run / create_vcf /
        create_interpretation / create_report. Each of those is @auditable,
        and @auditable commits when it returns. Called in a row they are four
        commits, and a failure at the third or fourth left a VCF with no
        interpretation, or an interpretation with no report, in the record --
        a lineage the platform never produced a report for. So this method
        performs the same inserts (same columns, same org scoping, same
        retention inheritance, same submission-key formula) inside ONE
        @transactional body, writes the same per-resource audit rows WITHOUT
        committing, and commits once. The existing methods are unchanged.

        VCF IDENTITY. `expected_vcf_hash` is the SHA-256 the caller took of
        the VCF BEFORE running the pipeline. It is recomputed here from the
        file on disk; if the two differ the run analysed different bytes from
        the ones about to be recorded against it, and VcfChangedError is
        raised before anything is written.

        DUPLICATES. uk_interp_submission makes a second interpretation of the
        same VCF content for the same sample impossible; that refusal
        surfaces as DuplicateInterpretationError (nothing from this attempt
        written) so a retrying worker can find the first one with
        find_interpretation_by_submission_key instead of failing.

        Refusals before any write: the sample is not in this organisation, or
        its order/patient chain does not resolve (NotFoundError), or the VCF
        changed (VcfChangedError). Any failure after the first write rolls
        every row back; the outer @auditable still records the attempt as an
        error.

    # 1. Transient submission failures (timeouts, retryable errors):
    #    - Caught by worker / submission layer
    #    - Call create_or_reopen_exception with:

    #      - owner: lab_operator
    #
    # 2. Interpretation failures (non-retryable Bij AI errors):
    #    - Caught by worker / submission result inspection
    #    - Call create_or_reopen_exception with:
    #      - category: INTERPRETATION_FAILURE
    #      - reason_code: BIJ_AI_ERROR_OTHER

    # The submission flow:
    # 1. Preconditions validated (5a)

        Resolve an exception, recording the resolution event and updating status.

        w129 GAP-1. This method used to have an asymmetry inside its own body:
        the UPDATE bound org_id, the INSERT did not. `_execute` returns None and
        never inspects rowcount, so when the UPDATE matched zero rows -- which is
        exactly what happens when the caller names another organisation's
        exception -- nothing stopped execution falling through into an INSERT
        that appended a 'resolve' row to the victim's append-only history. The
        method RETURNED NORMALLY. Measured, not reasoned.

        Two changes, and they are deliberately both here rather than either one
        alone:

          1. The exception is resolved org-scoped FIRST and a miss raises
             NotFoundError. A zero-row UPDATE must not be a silent success, and
             refusing here is also what makes the endpoint's two refusals
             identical -- a foreign id and an invented id both arrive at this
             same NotFoundError with the same message shape (w129 GAP-2).
          2. The event INSERT binds org_id from the session, and the schema's
             composite foreign key (exception_id, org_id) -> exceptions (id,
             org_id) makes the cross-tenant row inexpressible rather than merely
             unwritten. The guard above is the clean refusal; the key is the
             guarantee that survives the next person editing this method.

        ONE METHOD, NOT A COMPOSITION. The read, the UPDATE and the INSERT are
        written inline rather than delegated to get_exception_by_id or any other
        decorated method: @auditable commits after each audit row, so composing
        transactional work out of decorated methods destroys atomicity silently
        (the w128 lesson).

        'accept' as an INDEPENDENT CONCURRENCE BY A SECOND CLINICIAN, so the
        sole signatory writing one would write a row the schema itself defines
        as false: the record would assert two-clinician review where one
        person acted. A distinct kind makes the record true at the level
        things query it -- an audit asking which reports had independent
        concurrence answers correctly from claim_type alone, and a site that
        later adopts two-person sign-off can see which historical reports were
        single-signed.

        record another person's concurrence, which is exactly the falsehood
        this claim kind exists to stop.

        Submit a draft report for review: draft -> under_review (spec 13.1).

        The workflow entry point. _approve_report accepts only 'under_review',
        so without this method no report could legitimately reach approval at
        all -- this is the transition that makes the rest of the state machine
        reachable rather than an operator writing `state` by hand.

        Three preconditions, each refusing rather than silently proceeding:

        1. THE INTERPRETER ROLE, on the session invoking this. Reading a draft
           and adding the clinical interpretation is the Interpreter's work, so
           declaring that work finished is theirs. The Approver role is
           deliberately not accepted as a substitute: approving is the
           downstream check on this submission, and letting one identity do
           both without holding both roles would collapse the two-person
           control spec 13.3 rests on.

           Unlike _approve_report, this method takes no separate actor_id and
           so needs no second per-actor role check: there is no identity
           recorded here for anything downstream to read as an authority
           claim. The session gate is the whole of it.

        2. THE REPORT IS IN 'draft'. Any other state is refused with the state
           it actually found named in the message -- including 'under_review'
           itself, so a double submission is a refusal rather than a silent
           no-op that would leave a caller believing it had just submitted.

        3. AT LEAST ONE REVIEWER CLAIM AGAINST THIS REPORT.
           This is the substantive one. Zero claims means no review happened,
           and submitting then would put raw engine output into the approval
           queue with a human's submission standing behind it.

           Checked against THIS REPORT, not against its interpretation (R9,
           human ruling 2026-09-13: a report carries its own claims and only
           its own). The difference is the whole amendment case. An amendment
           is a second report on the same interpretation, so an
           interpretation-scoped check would let an amendment be submitted on
           the strength of the ORIGINAL's review -- the original's reviewer
           would stand behind a document they never read, which is the
           failure this precondition exists to prevent, arriving by the one
           route the old check could not see.

           This precondition is what makes the explicit 'accept' claim
           load-bearing rather than ceremonial. A reviewer who agrees with
           every call still leaves rows, so "I read it and concurred" and "I
           never looked" stop being indistinguishable in the record -- which
           is the whole reason spec 13.2 made accept an action rather than the
           absence of one.

        Writes nothing but `state`. approver_id, approved_at and content_hash
        stay NULL: submission is not approval, and the schema's
        reports_approval_complete CHECK holds precisely because this method
        does not touch them.

        Deterministic SHA-256 over exactly what an Approver reviewed: the
        interpretation's run_document AND the full set of reviewer_claims
        recorded against THIS REPORT, AS STORED.

        KEYED ON THE REPORT, NOT THE INTERPRETATION (R9 defect (b), human
        ruling 2026-09-13). It took interpretation_id and hashed every claim
        on the interpretation. An amendment is a second report row on the
        same interpretation, so the first claim recorded for an amendment
        landed inside the ORIGINAL report's recomputed hash and
        verify_report_integrity() reported the original as tampered with.
        Nothing had been tampered with, and a false alarm on an integrity
        check teaches people to ignore integrity checks.

        The rejected alternative was a cutoff at reports.approved_at, which
        needed no schema change. It was refused because it trades a false
        alarm for a real blind spot: a claim injected after approval is
        exactly what this hash exists to catch, and a timestamp cutoff
        cannot tell that injection apart from an amendment's first
        legitimate claim. See reviewer_claims.report_id's schema comment.

        run_document is still read through the report, so an amendment and
        its original -- which share an interpretation -- hash the same
        document and differ only where they genuinely differ: their claims.

        Shared by _approve_report (which writes the result) and
        verify_report_integrity (which recomputes it later and compares) so
        "the same canonicalisation" is a structural fact -- one function --
        rather than a discipline of keeping two call sites in sync by hand.

        WHY REVIEWER_CLAIMS ARE IN THIS HASH (this reverses an earlier
        decision; the correction is recorded here on purpose rather than
        silently, because the original reasoning was sound on its own terms
        and the distinction that overturns it is easy to lose again).

        The earlier version of this method excluded reviewer_claims because
        spec 13.2 leaves WHICH CLAIMS A RELEASED REPORT DISPLAYS, and how, as
        an explicitly undecided expert-branch question (see the six points
        in reviewer_claims's own schema comment) -- and hashing claims felt
        like fixing that undecided rendering into an immutability check
        before the branch was resolved.

        That reasoning conflates two different questions. Which claims are
        DISPLAYED is rendering, and the expert branch governs exactly that.
        Which claims EXISTED AT APPROVAL is a fact about what was approved,
        settled the moment the Approver signs, regardless of how any claim
        is later shown or on any surface. This hash captures the second
        question, not the first: rendering can still be decided freely, on
        its own timeline, without touching what this function computes.

        The cost of getting this wrong was asymmetric. Excluding claims left
        a real gap: a reviewer_claims row could be altered after approval
        (reviewer_claims is append-only against the application's own
        clinical_app role -- see schema.sql's grants -- but is not immune to
        a direct database write outside that role, which is exactly the
        threat a content hash exists to catch) and verify_report_integrity
        would report no tampering, because the one thing a human actually
        contributed to the approved record was the one thing not covered.
        Including claims that turn out to be irrelevant to some future
        rendering decision costs nothing verify_report_integrity cares
        about; excluding claims that turn out to matter costs the entire
        guarantee this function exists to provide.

        FIELDS HASHED PER CLAIM: EVERY stored column of a reviewer_claims
        row -- claim_type, variant_key, classification, reason, actor_id,
        timestamp, evidence_json, supersedes. There is no exclusion list.

        This is a second, later correction, and it is recorded here for the
        same reason the first one is: the two columns first left out were
        left out for reasons that looked sound in isolation and were wrong
        for the identical structural reason the original run_document-only
        scope was wrong.

          - evidence_json was excluded as "always NULL today, pending the
            expert-branch decision on what shape evidence takes." That is
            true today and is exactly the shape of the claims-exclusion bug
            this function already corrects once: a column that is empty NOW
            is not evidence it will stay empty, and evidence_json is
            precisely the column a re-derive reading of the expert branch
            would start writing into. Excluding it means the hash would
            silently stop covering reviewer evidence the moment that branch
            is decided, with nothing forcing this function to be revisited
            when it happens.
          - supersedes was excluded as "already covered where it matters,
            since a superseding claim is itself a row this function hashes."
            That covers a superseding claim being ADDED after the fact (a
            new row, which does change the hash), but not an EXISTING
            claim's supersedes value being altered in place to point
            somewhere else -- reviewer_claims is append-only against
            clinical_app, which makes that mutation unlikely, not
            impossible, and a hash that carries an exception for "the
            columns append-only makes unlikely" has an exception to explain
            every time someone reads it.

        The rule now, and the reason there is no numbered list of hashed
        columns to maintain: this function hashes every stored column of a
        reviewer_claims row. A column added to the schema later is hashed
        the day it exists, without this function needing to be revisited to
        remember to include it.

        Claims are ordered by (timestamp, id) for a stable serialisation --
        without a fixed order, two computations over the identical set of
        rows could serialise to different JSON and hash to different values,
        which would make this function non-deterministic over data that
        never changed. id is the reviewer_claims primary key, so (timestamp,
        id) is a genuine total order: id alone can never tie.

        Create an amendment: a new report referencing an existing approved
        report, with the reason recorded and traceability to what it
        replaces maintained by a forward pointer, not a mutated column.

        Spec 15.2 requires (GEPER's own rule -- see GEPER_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_SPEC.md
        #15.2; implements ISO 15189 7.4.1.8 b)/d), the wording below is ours, not
        the standard's):
          - The original report is never modified, never withdrawn from the record
          - Traceability to the original is maintained
          - Ordering clinician is notified

        This method writes three rows and nothing else: a new `reports` row
        (the amendment itself, draft state), one `amendments` row, and one
        `amendment_notifications` row. No UPDATE anywhere -- amendments and
        amendment_notifications are append-only against clinical_app (see
        schema.sql's grants), and this method does not attempt to be the
        exception. "Current amendment" is derived by query (the row named
        in `supersedes_amendment_id` by no other row), not stored as a
        boolean column that a later write would have to keep in sync.

        Delivery mechanism for the notification (email, SMS, etc.) is
        deferred to a later phase; this records the event itself, not the
        transport. Recorded as sent (read=FALSE: may not be read yet, but
        the fact of the notification is recorded).

        Preconditions:
          - Original report must exist in this org
          - Original report must be approved or released (not in draft/under_review/returned)
          - Reason for amendment is NOT NULL

        A second (or later) amendment of the same original chains off the
        current one: this method looks up whatever amendment of
        `original_report_id` nothing yet supersedes and records the new
        row's `supersedes_amendment_id` as that id, exactly the way
        reviewer_claims.supersedes chains. NULL means this is the first
        amendment of this original.
