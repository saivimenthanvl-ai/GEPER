pipeline/utils/process_control.py
──────────────────────────────────
Cross-platform subprocess lifecycle tracking, so a pipeline run started via
the API can actually be cancelled mid-flight on both POSIX and Windows.

Background (see hive dispatch 2026-09-02, "Windows process killing"):
``api/main.py``'s ``DELETE /api/v1/pipeline/{run_id}`` was supposed to kill
the running external tool (bwa, freebayes, ...) via ``PipelineRunner
.register_kill_callback()``, but that callback was never actually invoked
anywhere — every pipeline subprocess ran through ``pipeline/fastq/errors.py
::_run()``, which used the blocking ``subprocess.run()`` and never exposed
a live ``Popen`` handle to anything outside itself. Cancellation was
structurally impossible, not merely unwired. On top of that, nothing spawned
children with ``start_new_session``/``creationflags``, so had a kill signal
ever been sent, ``os.killpg()`` on POSIX would have targeted the API
server's own process group (children inherit their parent's pgid by
default) rather than a group scoped to the child.

This module is the single place that:

1. Spawns every pipeline subprocess (``spawn_tracked``), giving it its own
   killable scope (POSIX: new session/process group; Windows: new process
   group) and, when a run is in progress, handing the live ``Popen`` object
   to whatever callback ``PipelineRunner.run()`` registered via the
   ``_CURRENT_KILL_CALLBACK`` contextvar — so ``pipeline/fastq/errors.py``,
   ``pipeline/utils/reference_cache.py``, and any future caller get
   cancellability for free, with no signature changes to any of their own
   callers.
2. Terminates a tracked ``Popen`` and its full descendant tree
   (``kill_process_tree_now`` / ``request_termination_async``), using
   ``psutil`` to reach grandchildren neither ``os.killpg`` (POSIX, if a
   child itself calls ``setsid``) nor a bare Windows ``TerminateProcess``
   (which never reaches children at all) can.

Why a contextvar instead of threading a callback parameter through every
call site: ``PipelineRunner.run()`` executes entirely inside one dedicated
thread-pool worker thread per run_id (see ``api/main.py``'s
``ThreadPoolExecutor``), so a contextvar set once at the top of ``run()``
is visible to every ``_run()``/``spawn_tracked()`` call made anywhere
below it in that same call stack — including through ``resolve_reference``
→ ``ensure_bwa_index`` → ``_stream_subprocess_with_heartbeat`` — without
any of those 8+ intermediate functions needing to know tracking exists.
Concurrent runs never cross-talk: each worker thread has its own
contextvar value.
