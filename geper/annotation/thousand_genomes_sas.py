"""
1000 Genomes Project South Asian (SAS) sub-population frequency -- the
SOLE source for the "Indian Population Frequency" report section as of
2026-08-08.

Originally built as an honest fallback for when IndiGenomes
(`annotation/indigenomes.py`) was confirmed offline for a given run.
IndiGenomes itself was retired from GEPER's active query path entirely
on 2026-08-08 (see `DATA_SOURCE_LICENSE_AUDIT.md`: its own terms state
it "is intended for purely research purposes" and that "commercial use
... would require licensing," which GEPER has not obtained) -- so what
was a conditional fallback is now the unconditional, only source this
section has, run for every variant regardless of any other service's
availability. `annotation/indigenomes.py` is kept in the codebase, not
deleted, so IndiGenomes can be reinstated later if a commercial license
is obtained; until then, `pipeline/orchestrator.py` never calls it.

Investigation this is built from (2026-08-08, live-verified)
=======================================================================
Ensembl's own REST API (`rest.ensembl.org`, already a GEPER dependency
via `pipeline/pvs1/lookup.py`/`pipeline/clingen/utils.py`) exposes real,
live, per-sub-population 1000 Genomes phase_3 allele frequencies with no
new external service, no login, no access barrier:

  `GET /variation/human/{rsID}?pops=1` returns a `populations` list
  including entries like `{"population":
  "1000GENOMES:phase_3:GIH", "allele": "G", "allele_count": 122,
  "frequency": 0.592233...}` for every one of GIH/PJL/BEB/STU/ITU, plus
  the pooled `1000GENOMES:phase_3:SAS` figure -- confirmed live against
  rs699 (real numbers: BEB 117/172, GIH 122/206, ITU 127/204, PJL
  117/192, STU 139/204 G-allele counts/totals).

This endpoint is keyed by rsID, not by chrom:pos:ref:alt, so getting
from GEPER's native coordinate a variant is queried by requires a first
resolution step. Two candidate approaches were investigated:

  1. `database/dbsnp_client.py` -- GEPER's existing rsID resolver, but
     it queries NCBI E-utilities, a distinct external service with its
     own independent uptime (already separately HEALTH-tracked as
     "dbSNP"). Routing this fallback's resolution step through it would
     couple "IndiGenomes is down, use the fallback" to a THIRD external
     service's availability, undermining the whole point of a fallback
     meant to be resilient.
  2. Ensembl's own `overlap/region/human/{chrom}:{pos}-{pos}?feature=
     variation` endpoint -- returns candidate rsIDs at a position with
     their `alleles` (`[ref, alt, ...]`), confirmed live (e.g. rs699 ->
     `{"id": "rs699", "alleles": ["A", "G"], "start": 230710048, ...}`).
     Chosen: this keeps the entire fallback chain -- resolution AND
     population lookup -- inside the one already-integrated, already-
     HEALTH-tracked Ensembl dependency, with no new external service.

Best of all: `pipeline/orchestrator.py` already runs the dbSNP stage
before the IndiGenomes stage every variant, so when dbSNP DID resolve an
rsID this run (`dbsnp_result["found"]` and `dbsnp_result["rsid"]`),
`ThousandGenomesSASLookup.query_variant`'s `rsid_hint` parameter lets the
orchestrator hand that over directly -- zero extra network calls beyond
the population lookup itself. The `overlap/region` resolution above is
only reached when dbSNP genuinely has no rsID for this position (or
wasn't queried this run), as a self-contained, Ensembl-only fallback of
the fallback.

Reliability honesty
=======================================================================
This module reuses the "Ensembl" `utils/service_health.py` HEALTH entry
every other Ensembl-dependent stage already shares (see
`config.py::ThousandGenomesSASConfig`'s docstring) -- deliberately NOT a
new, separately-tracked service, since it genuinely is the same host.
`utils/service_health.py`'s own module docstring records Ensembl
throwing intermittent 500/502/503s in this exact session; this fallback
inherits that, not a cleaner reliability story just because it has a
different name from IndiGenomes.

Mandatory disclosures
=======================================================================
`SAMPLE_SIZES`/`TOTAL_SAMPLE_SIZE` and `_POPULATION_LABELS` below exist
specifically so the report layer never shows a bare population code
(a clinician-facing report reading "GIH" with no context is worse than
useless) and never omits the sample-size or diaspora-origin caveat --
see `report/clinical_report_builder.py::_indian_population_frequency`
for where both are rendered.
