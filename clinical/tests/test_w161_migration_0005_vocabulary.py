─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
w161 — MIGRATION 0005, THE EXCEPTION-AMENDMENT ACTION VOCABULARY, and the
first DESTRUCTIVE migration this stack has ever carried.

WHAT IS BEING PROVED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SAME SHAPE AS 0003 OR 0004. Those
two were ADDITIVE: they created objects, so "did it work" and "did it break
anything" were nearly the same question, and every assertion could be a
presence probe. 0005 DROPS a constraint and re-adds a wider one. Presence is
now the weakest thing that can be asserted: a database whose action CHECK has
been dropped and never restored PASSES every presence probe ever written about
`exception_events`, and accepts the string 'banana' in its action column.

So the four properties below are asserted SEPARATELY, because each fails
differently and three of them are invisible to the other's test:

  1. THE VOCABULARY IS WIDENED — 'amend_resolution' is writable.
  2. NOTHING EXISTING IS REJECTED — and proved with rows planted BEFORE the
     migration runs, not only with writes attempted after it.
  3. THE CONSTRAINT IS STILL A CONSTRAINT — a fifth token is still refused.
     Without this row, (1) is satisfied by dropping the CHECK entirely.
  4. FRESH AND UPGRADED CONVERGE — the same `pg_get_constraintdef`, byte for
     byte, on a database built from `clinical/schema.sql` and on one carried
     up by the migrations.

─── THE WRONG VERSIONS, AND WHICH ROWS CATCH EACH ───

Every one of these was BUILT AND RUN, and the counts were read rather than the
colour (Rule 10). Every row named here takes either no fixture at all or a
scratch database it creates itself, so none of them can SKIP: a skip and a pass
are the same green dot, and a wrong-version experiment that skips is a failed
experiment, not a result.

(A) 0005 DECLARING NO POST-CONDITION — the w160 rule's first real customer.
    Caught by `TestTheW160RuleBitesOnThisVeryFile`, which strips the
    `MIGRATION-ASSERT` line from 0005's own bytes, hands the resulting set to
    `migrate()`, and requires `MigrationNotVerifiable` AND that nothing was
    applied. Paired with the positive twin: the same set with the line put back
    applies and reports ok.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: everything about the DDL. A 0005 containing `SELECT 1`
    would pass it.

(B) THE CONSTRAINT RECREATED WITHOUT THE EXISTING TOKENS.
    Caught by `TestNothingExistingIsRejected::test_rows_written_before_the_
    migration_survive_it` (the migration would FAIL to commit — ADD CONSTRAINT
    validates existing rows) and by
    `test_each_old_verb_is_still_writable_afterwards`. Also caught, without any
    row at all in the table, by the post-condition itself: it requires all four
    tokens in the rendered definition.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: A and D.

(C) `schema.sql` AND THE MIGRATION DISAGREEING.
    Caught by `TestFreshAndUpgradedConverge`, and independently by the drift
    detector this repository already has —
    `test_w126m_schema_equivalence.py::test_schema_sql_and_the_migration_set_
    produce_the_same_catalog` — which diffs `pg_get_constraintdef` across the
    whole schema. Both are kept: the whole-catalogue diff is the mechanism, and
    the row here names THIS constraint so the failure is readable.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: A. Two databases can agree perfectly on a definition that
    declares nothing.

(D) THE CONSTRAINT DROPPED AND NEVER RE-ADDED.
    Caught by `TestTheConstraintIsStillAConstraint`, which attempts a token
    that is in no vocabulary and requires the database to refuse it — the
    positive-twin discipline Rule 4 asks for, since every other row in this
    file would pass against a table with no CHECK at all. Also caught by the
    post-condition's `contype = 'c'` clause and by convergence (C).
    VACUOUS AGAINST: B, whose constraint exists and is merely too narrow.

(E) THE POST-CONDITION SATISFIED BY THE OLD DEFINITION.
    Caught by `TestThePostConditionActuallyDistinguishesTheGenerations`, which
    evaluates 0005's OWN declared post-conditions against a real database
    stopped at generation 4 and requires them to be FALSE, then applies 0005
    and requires them to be TRUE. This is the row the whole wave turns on: a
    post-condition that is true before the migration measures nothing, and
    `to_regclass('exception_events')` — which would satisfy w160's rule — is
    exactly that.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: nothing in the DDL. It is a statement about the
    declaration.

─── ATOMICITY ───

`TestTheDestructiveStepIsAtomic` is the one that could not be written as a
presence probe. It proves there is no window in which the table has no action
CHECK, by making the SECOND statement fail and requiring the FIRST to be undone
with it — the old three-verb constraint still present, unchanged, and the
history row absent. That is the property the human named, and it is proved by
breaking it rather than by asserting that `_apply` looks transactional.

        It is out of scope because it is a SEMANTIC rule about what an
        amendment must carry, not a vocabulary, and settling it means ruling on
        the amendment verb — which this wave was explicitly not authorised to
        do. Its failure is the correct signal for the verb's wave.
