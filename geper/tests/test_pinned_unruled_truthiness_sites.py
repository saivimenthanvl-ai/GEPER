"""
PINNED, NOT ENDORSED. Three truthiness sites that are still UNRULED.

Every test in this file asserts WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. Not one of them
asserts that today's behaviour is correct, and none of them should be
read as agreeing with it. They exist so that whoever rules on these
three questions finds the current answer WRITTEN DOWN rather than
having to re-derive it from the code and then guess whether it was
deliberate.

WHY PIN INSTEAD OF FIX. These three differ in kind from the 18 sites
already fixed (12 stage guards in 85c651c, 6 provenance guards
alongside this file). Those were RECORDS -- a failed lookup logged as a
success. These three change CLINICAL OUTPUT or the run's own account of
it, so "fix the truthiness bug" is not a mechanical call: each one
first needs a count of how many variants currently produce output that
would change. The counts are done and reported; the rulings are not.

WHAT AN UNPINNED CURRENT BEHAVIOUR ACTUALLY IS. Not neutral, and not
"no decision yet": it is an undecided answer already in force on every
run, quietly, with nobody having chosen it. Writing it into a test does
not endorse it -- it makes it visible and makes any change to it
deliberate, which is the whole difference between a decision and a
drift.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SITE 1  PP4 on an EMPTY curated disease list -- *** RULED 2026-08-28,
        AND THIS CLASS IS NOW INVERTED. *** The question was: is "this
        gene has no curated diseases at all" a SINGLE GENETIC ETIOLOGY?
        Ruling: no. A gene with no curated diseases has not answered
        that question either way, so it cannot satisfy the condition.
        58f5fe5 had fixed only the UNKNOWN case (missing key / None);
        `[]` is not None, survived that guard, and still satisfied the
        condition until this ruling. The class below now pins the RULED
        behaviour and is no longer "not endorsed".

SITE 2  orchestrator.py:1313  _classify_variant_result -- *** RULED
        2026-08-28, AND THIS CLASS IS NOW INVERTED. *** It read
        `if context.get("error"):`, so an empty-string sequence-context
        error did not mark the variant "skipped" and it was counted and
        reported as analysed. Ruled: a context that failed with no
        message still failed. Fixed even though the count was 0, to
        stop the site being a trap for whoever adds a second producer.

SITE 3  conservation, provider.py:248 AND orchestrator.py:1810 --
        *** RULED 2026-08-28, FIXED AS A PAIR, AND THIS CLASS IS NOW
        INVERTED. *** orchestrator held
        `error = conservation_result.get("error")` then `if error and
        not found:` -- an ASSIGNMENT, which is why no AST scan keyed on
        `ast.If` tests ever saw it, and why an empty-string conservation
        error recorded no failure.
        THE TWO SITES HAD TO MOVE TOGETHER. provider.py:248's own
        `if payload.get("error"):` filtered an empty UCSC error body out
        before it could ever reach the orchestrator, so the downstream
        bug was unreachable -- one truthiness bug hiding another.
        Fixing :1810 alone gives a correct handler that never receives
        the case it handles. Fixing :248 alone makes the empty body
        flow through to a guard that still drops it, which is strictly
        worse than either. The class below is therefore backed by a
        FULL-PATH test, not by two isolated ones.

    Until this ruling these tests pinned the OPPOSITE assertion -- that
    an empty curated disease list TRIGGERED PP4 -- under a docstring
    saying the behaviour was pinned and not endorsed. The ruling is that
    "no curated diseases at all" does NOT satisfy PP4's single-etiology
    condition: such a gene has not answered the question either way, and
    `len([]) <= threshold` resolving to True was the empty-means-
    satisfied collapse, pointed at AWARDING a pathogenic-supporting
    criterion.

    THIS IS WHAT THE PIN WAS FOR. The ruling was made against a written
    answer -- these assertions -- rather than against code someone had
    to re-derive and then guess whether it was deliberate. The edit that
    inverts them is the visible mark of the decision.

    COUNT THE RULING WAS MADE ON: 0 of the 5,268 gene symbols in the
    real HPO `genes_to_phenotype.txt` release (332,599 rows) produce an
    empty list, so nothing routed through the LOCAL dataset changes
    output today.

    WHICH RELEASE? NOBODY CAN SAY, AND THAT IS THE POINT (recorded
    2026-09-11 after trying to re-derive this count and finding it
    cannot be re-derived). `genes_to_phenotype.txt` IS NOT IN THIS
    REPOSITORY. It is an auto-fetched cache --
    `pipeline/hpo/bootstrap.py::genes_to_phenotype_cache_path()`, under
    the model cache -- downloaded from purl.obolibrary.org and replaced
    silently once `_is_fresh` decides it has aged past
    `CONFIG.hpo.AUTO_FETCH_TTL_HOURS`. It is absent from a fresh
    checkout, and it is a different file on every machine depending on
    when that machine last fetched.
    THE COUNT ABOVE NAMES A ROW TOTAL AND NO VERSION, DATE OR CHECKSUM,
    so this file cannot tell you which release it was true of, and no
    attempt is made here to guess one or to attribute one to whoever
    measured it. That is not an omission being confessed -- it is the
    load-bearing fact: THE NUMBER READS AS A MEASURED PROPERTY OF HPO
    AND IS A MEASURED PROPERTY OF ONE UNIDENTIFIED SNAPSHOT OF HPO.
    An HPO release that curates one gene against zero diseases moves
    this count, changes what PP4 does on that gene, and nothing here
    would say so -- which is the same shape as the card this class came
    from (a count of zero resting on something nobody pinned), one
    level down: THERE THE UNPINNED THING WAS CODE, HERE IT IS DATA, AND
    DATA IS NOT EVEN IDENTIFIED. The live API fallback CAN reach it
    (`provider.py:273` builds phenotype associations with no disease_id
    at all, so `distinct_disease_ids` comes only from a separate
    `diseases` payload that may be empty). That path remains UNMEASURED
    -- measuring it costs live API calls the human declined to spend,
    which is a decision and not a gap. The exposure is real and its size
    is unknown.
