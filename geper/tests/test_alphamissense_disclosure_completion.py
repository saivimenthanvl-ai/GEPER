"""
Tests for the AlphaMissense clinical-use-disclosure completion.
83e2093 caveated PP3/BP4 only; a full enumeration (content-mode grep
across every render path, traced back to its actual producer function --
never trusting a field name) found four more sites where an
AlphaMissense score/class/pathogenicity call reaches a reader with no
caveat:
  - BP1 (`acmg_rules.py::_bp1_opposing_missense_evidence`)
  - the legacy pre-ACMG evidence sentence (`interpretation.py::
    InterpretationEngine.interpret`) -- THE SEVERE ONE: this sentence
    and PP3's own sentence can both land in the same variant's
    `supporting_evidence` list (same guard condition -- any variant
    where AlphaMissense returns a real hit populates both), worded
    differently enough that exact-string dedup never merges them.
  - the raw Markdown "### AlphaMissense" block (`report_generator.py::
    _render_alphamissense`)
  - the "### 7. AI Consensus" bullet (`report_generator.py::generate`)
  - the conflict-resolution direction-only mention
    (`conflict_resolution_engine.py::_ai_conflict`)

THE DANGEROUS CASE this whole card exists to catch: a report where
AlphaMissense appears in more than one place. Every test below asserts
EVERY AlphaMissense mention it finds is caveated -- never merely that
one is, or that the caveat appears "somewhere" -- because an assertion
of the weaker shape would have PASSED even before this fix, which is
the same cannot-fail defect class 83e2093 itself was found to have.
`TestDangerousCaseBothSentencesCaveated` is the concrete instance the
dispatch specifically asked for: real production code (not a hand-typed
fixture standing in for it) produces two independently-worded
AlphaMissense sentences for one variant, and both must carry the
caveat.

    HIGH 3 / AM-07 (2026-08-28, ruled): both sites now source that
    sentence from the same shared `alphamissense_evidence_sentence`

    exact-match `_dedupe` in `interpretation_result.py` -- unmodified,
    no new code there -- collapses them to one line on its own. Before
    this fix, this test asserted `len(am_lines) >= 2` (two differently-
    worded, individually-caveated duplicates survived dedup, which is
