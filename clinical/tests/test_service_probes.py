THE READINESS PROBE'S NEGATIVE CONTROL, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON THE PROBE IS
WORTH HAVING.

A readiness endpoint that returns 200 is evidence of nothing until you have
watched it return 503. `kim_pipeline/api/main.py`'s `/api/v1/ready` returns
`{"status": "ready"}` unconditionally and would pass a "does /readyz answer
200?" test forever, on a machine with no database at all.

So every test here that asserts ready is paired with one that breaks exactly
one precondition and asserts NOT ready -- and asserts the REASON, because
three different failures returning one indistinguishable 503 would send an
operator to the wrong place.

The liveness/readiness split is tested too: `/healthz` must keep answering 200
while the database is unreachable. If it did not, a database outage would
restart-loop every replica instead of draining traffic from them.

        Before this change `include_router` appeared once in the repository,
        in a test file. The routes existed and nothing served them.

        Takes `bootstrapped` so the DSN is configured. It used to matter for a
        second reason: without it these routes answered 503 rather than 401,
        because `_get_session` depends on `_get_data_access` and an
        unconfigured service outranked an unauthenticated caller.

        THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE, and the change is w132 fix B: an unconfigured
        service, an unreachable one and a bad credential are now the same 401
        with the same body, because the difference was readable by an
        anonymous caller as the state of the clinical database. So the DSN no
        longer changes what these routes answer — but the fixture stays,
