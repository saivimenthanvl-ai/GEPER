──────────────────────────
Generates a small, fast, biologically real FASTQ/reference validation
dataset for the Kim -> GEPER combined pipeline.

Design (see README_TEST_DATASET.md for full rationale):

  * Reference: the real revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS,
    NCBI accession NC_012920.1) — the actual human mitochondrial genome
    used as contig "MT" in GRCh38. 16,569 bp, single contig, GC ~44%
    (comfortably inside Kim's QC GC-fraction thresholds), tiny enough
    to align in well under a second in Google Colab.
  * Variant: reads are generated from a copy of the reference carrying
    a single homozygous substitution at 1-based position 3243 (A>G) —
    the real, well-known pathogenic m.3243A>G variant in MT-TL1
    (MELAS/MIDD), so the workflow exercises a clinically meaningful
    variant rather than an arbitrary one.
  * Reads: 150 bp single-end, tiled across the whole genome at a 9 bp
    step (≈16.7x average coverage — comfortably above Kim's
    min_total_reads=100 and variant_calling filter_min_depth=10
    thresholds), with a low, realistic per-base sequencing error rate
    and Phred quality scores well above the QC min_mean_quality=20
    threshold.
