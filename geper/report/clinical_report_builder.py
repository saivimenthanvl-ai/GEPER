Phase 5 -- Clinical Report Upgrade.

Builds one structured, clinician-oriented "clinical report" per variant
from the canonical `InterpretationResult` dict (Phase 2), including the
confidence (Phase 3) and prioritization (Phase 4) data already attached
to it. Every section below reads a field `InterpretationResult` already
computed -- nothing here re-derives evidence from raw provider dicts a
second time (the one exception, `raw_evidence`, is itself a field
`InterpretationResult` already carries -- see interpretation_result.py),
and nothing is invented that GEPER doesn't actually have.

Single source of truth: both `report/json_builder.py` (adds this dict
as an additive `clinical_report` key) and `report/report_generator.py`
(renders this same dict as Markdown) call `build_clinical_report()` --
so the two output formats can never drift out of sync, per the Phase 5
requirement to "reuse InterpretationResult instead of rebuilding logic
repeatedly."

# What GEPER claims about itself, stated once for every renderer.
#
# GEPER is a variant prioritisation system that assists qualified
# clinicians and pathologists. It produces a draft classification
# requiring qualified human review and final sign-off before any
# clinical use, and does not independently provide final clinical
# interpretation. That is the project's settled position as of EJ-01
# (ratified 2026-08-22), asserted consistently elsewhere --
# `README.md`'s "Clinical disclaimer" section,
# `pipeline/explainability_engine.py`, `kim_pipeline/api/main.py`'s
# public API description, and `kim_pipeline/pipeline/reporting/
# stage.py` / `pdf_report.py`'s separately-worded copy.
#
# Until 2026-08-22 this comment and the constant below stated a
# narrower position instead -- "GEPER is a research pipeline, not a
# clinical diagnostic tool" -- partly on the strength of "the CC
# BY-NC-SA 4.0 non-commercial-research licence the project ships
# under." That licence claim was itself wrong and has been corrected,
# not just reworded: GEPER has no licence of its own anywhere in this
# repository (no LICENSE/LICENSE.md/COPYING file and no licence field
# in any build config, except one vendored third-party file under
# `geper/hyena-dna/`). The CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 references that old comment
# leaned on are inbound, on specific data sources and model weights
# (e.g. AlphaMissense, `LICENSE_AUDIT.md`'s model weights, PharmVar
# per `GROUND_TRUTH_DATASET_AUDIT.md`) -- not a licence GEPER itself
# ships under. See `VALIDATION_BASELINE_2026-08-21.md:263` for that
# earlier verdict, annotated superseded rather than rewritten: it was
# correct against the research-vs-clinical-use question it was
# actually answering at the time.
#
# Until 2026-08-21 the clinical PDF also carried a second, contradicting
# statement -- US CLIA/LDT template wording asserting the report was
# "intended for clinical use" -- so a single rendered PDF asserted both
# claims on different pages, and the Markdown report carried a third,
# separately-worded copy of this one. All three were replaced by this
# constant that day. Its positioning sentence was then updated again the
# following day per EJ-01, above; the mandatory-review clause salvaged
# from the retired CLIA/LDT text is now folded into that same sentence
# rather than kept as a separate clause.
#
# PLAIN PROSE, DELIBERATELY: no Markdown, no PDF markup, no leading
# label. Each renderer applies its own wrapper (`report_generator.py`
# a blockquote, `report/summary.py` a styled Paragraph). The previous
# Markdown copy existed because the PDF's version had its formatting
# baked in and therefore could not be imported -- the fork was the only
# option available, not carelessness. Keep this string presentation-free
# or the next renderer with different markup needs will fork it again.
#
# UPDATED 2026-09-13 (W116, human ruling): the opening clause is now "an
# automated pipeline", not "an automated research pipeline". The product
# is sold for clinical use and its reports carry a clinical sign-off, so
# the old opening stated a regulatory category that contradicts the
# deployment. ONLY that clause changed; the rest of the sentence is
# untouched, and `ISO_RESEARCH_ELEMENT` below keeps "research or
# development programme" because that is ISO 15189's own clause language
# and the human explicitly held it.
#
# THE NAME IS LEGACY AND WAS LEFT ALONE DELIBERATELY. It records where
# this constant came from, not what it now claims -- do not re-derive the
# retired "research pipeline" wording from it. It was not renamed because
# the ruling was about clinician-facing prose and this identifier is
# never rendered; renaming it would churn ~40 call sites across two trees
# that cannot import each other, plus `geper/LIMS_EXPORT_MAPPING.md` and
# dated validation records that name it as it stood. Rename it if a
# later change needs to touch those sites anyway -- in BOTH trees at once
# or `tests/test_ej01_disclaimer_cross_tree_drift.py` is the only thing
# left holding them together.

# our own phrasing would require an assessor to evaluate our prose rather than recognise a
# defined slot. Do not paraphrase this text or harmonise it with other disclaimers -- the ISO
# language is the point.

# The same positioning claim as `RESEARCH_USE_DISCLAIMER` above, in the
# short form a document can lead with. NOT an independent statement --
# if the two ever disagree, this one is wrong: the disclaimer is the
# canonical text and this is its headline.
#
# It exists because prominence is not a font size. The Markdown report
# puts its status banner on line 3, above everything, so a reader learns
# what the document IS before they read what it FOUND. The PDF carried
# the same claim only in 6.5pt footer text below a grey rule, sharing
# the smallest type on the page with the AI-disclosure line -- present,
# and unread. `report/summary.py` renders this at the top of page 1,
# above the findings table, for that reason.
#
# DELIBERATELY SAYS NOTHING ABOUT REVIEW STATUS. Draft/reviewed/
# overridden is a per-run fact and belongs to the footer's own status

# Orphanet/Orphadata (CC-BY-4.0) is a genuine exception to the

# run (`pipeline/orphanet/bootstrap.py`, live-verified working in
# `DATA_PROVENANCE.md`), but as of 2026-08-08 that data is not wired

    variant's evidence-dependent sections (protein/structural/
    population/clinical knowledge, sequence context) are built from.

    `interpretation_result["raw_evidence"]`: `InterpretationResult

    duplicating data already emitted under the top-level `uniprot`/
    `interpro`/`gnomad`/etc. keys), so `interpretation_result` here --

    raw-evidence-derived sections (protein/structural/population/
    clinical knowledge, sequence context) unconditionally reported

    a live Colab run where the report claimed "UniProt: no entry
    resolved" in this section while the same report's own Annotation
    Detail trail, built from the actual stage output, showed a
    resolved accession two sections later). Kept optional and

    isn't a breaking API change for any other future caller.

    `indigenomes_result`: VESTIGIAL as of 2026-08-08 -- IndiGenomes was

    restrict commercial use, which GEPER has not licensed; see

    `DATA_SOURCE_LICENSE_AUDIT.md`). Still accepted here, purely so
    every existing caller (`report/json_builder.py`, this module's own
    tests) keeps working without a signature-breaking change, but it is
    no longer read or passed to `_indian_population_frequency` below --
    there is no longer an "IndiGenomes vs. fallback" branch to feed. If
    IndiGenomes is ever reinstated, restore the argument's use here
    alongside `pipeline/orchestrator.py::_run_indigenomes_stage`.

    `thousand_genomes_sas_result`: the raw 1000 Genomes SAS provider
    dict (see `annotation/thousand_genomes_sas.py
    ::ThousandGenomesSASLookup.query_variant`) -- the SOLE source for
    the `indian_population_frequency` section below as of 2026-08-08

    """
    India-deployment feature: gnomAD's South Asian (SAS) subpopulation
    allele frequency alongside the 1000 Genomes Project's SAS
    sub-population frequency (see `annotation/thousand_genomes_sas.py`'s
    module docstring), plus a single "common in Indian populations"
    flag when either exceeds `CONFIG.indigenomes.COMMON_AF_THRESHOLD`
    (default 1%).

    AS OF 2026-08-08, 1000 Genomes SAS is the SOLE Indian/South-Asian
    cohort source this section shows, run unconditionally for every
    variant -- see `annotation/thousand_genomes_sas.py`'s module
    docstring and `config.py::ThousandGenomesSASConfig`'s docstring for
    why: IndiGenomes (the source this originally sat alongside, and
    which this was built as an offline-fallback for) was retired from
    GEPER's active query path entirely, because its own terms restrict
    commercial use and GEPER has not obtained a license (see
    `DATA_SOURCE_LICENSE_AUDIT.md`). There is therefore no longer an
    "IndiGenomes vs. 1000 Genomes SAS fallback" branch here -- unlike
    the prior version of this function, `sas_*` below is simply THE
    result whenever this section has anything to show, the same way any
    other single-source report field is rendered, not something gated
    on another source's confirmed-offline state.

    The two mandatory disclosures (`SAMPLE_SIZE_DISCLOSURE`/
    `DIASPORA_DISCLOSURE`, see `annotation/thousand_genomes_sas.py`)
    matter more now than when this was an occasional fallback -- they
    must appear every time this section shows anything from this
    source, not conditionally. This function doesn't render them
    itself (that's `report/report_generator.py`'s and
    `report/summary.py`'s job, both importing the same shared text so
    Markdown and PDF never drift on wording), but `sas_shown` below is
    unconditionally true whenever there's a gnomAD-SAS or 1000-Genomes-
    SAS figure to report, so the renderer always has a reason to
    include them.

    `gnomad_af_sas` is read from `raw["gnomad"]["population_breakdown"]`
    (already computed by the gnomAD stage -- see
    `pipeline/gnomad/models.py::POPULATIONS`), not re-queried here.
    `sas_population_labels`/`sas_sample_sizes`/`sas_total_sample_size`
    are carried through explicitly (not left for the renderer to
    hardcode or, worse, omit) so every render of this source --
    Markdown and both PDF paths -- states both mandatory disclosures
    the same way, from the same source of truth. Deliberately NOT
    folded into `common_in_indian_population` below: `sas_pooled`'s AF
    is a small, diaspora-sourced figure (see
    `annotation/thousand_genomes_sas.py`'s disclosures) and mixing it
    into the same threshold check as gnomAD's much larger SAS reference
    population would let a genuinely low-confidence number quietly

    `is_reanalysis`, `has_been_reanalysed`) and `banners`, the rendered text
    in display order. Superseded comes FIRST: "do not act on this document"
    outranks every other statement on the page.

    `None` stays `None` -- NOT an all-false block. A pipeline run cannot know
    whether the clinical platform will later store it as a re-analysis, so an
    unsupplied state must not read as "not a re-analysis". An explicitly
    supplied block with no state (`{}`) is all-false with no banners.

    `*_basis` is 'released' (default) or 'approved' and decides which sentence
    the date is printed in -- R2/R4, see `_revision_basis`. `retained=False`
    says retention has deleted the amendment report -- R8. `amendment_count`
    replaces `reason` when more than one amendment is in force -- R5.

    Raises `ValueError` on a state block missing a required field, carrying
    both or neither of reason/amendment_count, or naming an unrecognised date
    basis (see `_revision_block` and `_revision_basis`). R7: a revision record
    that cannot be read is an error, never a marker and never an omission.

# fixed, in function form rather than constant form: content every renderer
# needs, living inside one of them, is what produced two independently
# worded disclaimers that drifted into contradicting each other. Anything
# a second renderer needs belongs here, where all of them already import
# from.

# of this change is the location, and renaming would have churned every

def _offline_sources_caveat_text(document: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Run-level, not per-finding: which external evidence sources (see
    `utils/service_health.py`) did not fully answer during this run, so
    that "not evaluated" or "not found" text elsewhere in the report is
    never mistaken for a completed, negative search. Returns `None`
    only when every source was reachable at startup AND none failed
    during the run.

    TWO KINDS OF UNAVAILABILITY, REPORTED SEPARATELY BECAUSE THEY MEAN
    DIFFERENT THINGS:

      offline at startup -- never queried for any variant this run.
      failed during the run -- queried, failed, retried. The client
          may have recovered on a later attempt or fallen back to a
          graceful skip, so evidence from it may be present, partial,
          or absent, and the report cannot tell the reader which.

    The second kind used to be reported nowhere. `offline_services()`
    only knows about services LATCHED OFFLINE AT STARTUP, so a source
    that was healthy at startup and then failed mid-run produced no
    caveat at all -- while its handled failures never reached any
    variant's `errors` list either (that list collects stage
    exceptions, and a retried failure raises none). Observed 2026-08-29:
    Ensembl probed Online (1155 ms) at startup, failed 3/3 attempts on a
    sequence region and 3/3 on an exon annotation mid-run, and the run
    wrote `errors: []`, `run_complete: true` and four output artefacts
    that said nothing about it, while the console printed
    `Ensembl ... Intermittent (2 failures)` and exited. The one visible
    consequence was an exon-annotation lookup rendered as the
    biological claim "no exon annotation found near this variant" -- for
    a canonical splice-acceptor variant.

    PREFER THE DOCUMENT, FALL BACK TO THE LIVE REGISTRY. When
    `document` carries a `service_health` list (written by
    `report/json_builder.py` from `ServiceHealthRegistry.snapshot()`),
    this reads that. Otherwise it reads the live `HEALTH` singleton, as
    it always did, so a legacy document produced before that field
    existed still renders the startup-offline caveat.

    Reading the document matters for re-renders. `review/signoff.py`
    loads a stored `geper_results.json` back in a FRESH PROCESS and
    re-invokes both PDF renderers and the Markdown generator against
    it. In that process `HEALTH` has never run a check, so the live
    registry is empty and this function returned `None` unconditionally
    -- meaning approving a run in which a source was offline produced a
    SIGNED, clinician-facing PDF with the caveat silently dropped. Same
    failure, and the same fix, as `qc_metrics` on
    `report/json_builder.py::JSONResultBuilder`: a caveat in the
    document survives, an argument passed once does not.

    IndiGenomes no longer appears here as of 2026-08-08: it's retired
    from GEPER's active query path (see `config.py::IndiGenomesConfig`'s
    docstring and `DATA_SOURCE_LICENSE_AUDIT.md`), which also disables
    its `utils/service_health.py` startup probe by default -- a source
    that's never checked can never show up as "confirmed offline"
    here, so this caveat mechanism naturally stops mentioning it
    without needing a special case.

    Validates one `qc_metrics[key]` entry against the required
    `{"status", "value", "reason"}` shape. This is the single choke
    point a raw number must pass through before `_qc_status`'s `>=`
    comparison can ever see it -- anything that doesn't parse into
    exactly this shape (a bare float where the dict belongs, a missing
    or unrecognized `status`, a `status: "found"` with no usable
    numeric `value`) fails THIS metric closed to ERROR rather than
    being coerced into a number to compare against a threshold. This
    is what makes the B-series fabricated-PASS-on-placeholder-numbers
    regression structurally impossible here, not merely avoided by
    convention: there is no code path from an untrusted input to
    `_qc_status` that skips this validation.

    `unrecognized_keys`: keys the caller's raw `qc_metrics` dict carried
    that are none of `_QC_METRIC_ORDER` (2026-09-11 ruling,
    PHASE8-bij-interpret, option B). When THIS key is absent (`entry is
    None`) and the caller's submission was non-empty but used a name
    GEPER doesn't recognize -- e.g. an external submitter's
    `{"depth": 50}` -- "not reported by the upstream pipeline" would be
    a FALSE SENTENCE: something WAS reported, just not under a
    recognized name. Say so honestly instead. Safety net beneath option
    A's boundary validation (geper/api/submission_worker.py::
    _qc_metrics_validated), which rejects an unrecognized key outright
    for any caller routed through that boundary -- this covers any
    OTHER caller that reaches this function directly.
