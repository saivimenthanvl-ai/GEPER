Clinical-grade PDF report generator.

Renders the same JSON document shape `report/json_builder.py::JSONResultBuilder.build()`
produces as a multi-page, ReportLab-based PDF suitable for a hospital
laboratory's diagnostic record: a title/logo header (first page only --
see `_build_report_header`), a one-page skimmable Clinician Summary
(`_build_clinician_summary_flowables` -- sample identity, one compact row
per variant, and any reviewer-attention flags, ending in a page break; see
that function's docstring for how it differs from each variant's own
"Executive Summary" paragraph), a patient/sample header, a sequencing
QC status table, one section per variant finding (reusing
`report/clinical_report_builder.py`'s already-computed evidence --
nothing here re-derives ACMG classification or evidence from raw
provider dicts a second time), a pathologist sign-off block, and a
standard legal disclaimer.

Entry point: `generate_pdf(document, output_path, patient_meta=None,
run_id=None, logo_path=None)`. Run-level QC is read from `document`
rather than passed in -- see `_document_qc_metrics`.

Compliance note (India DPDP Act 2023, not HIPAA/GDPR -- this is an
India-market product): this module parses and renders whatever
patient_meta it is given; it does not itself implement the DPDP Act's
consent, purpose-limitation, data-minimization, or retention/deletion
requirements, and makes no claim of compliance anywhere in its code or
rendered output. Real compliance sign-off must come from someone
qualified to review this against DPDP Act requirements (and any
applicable state/ICMR clinical-lab regulations) before production/
hospital use -- see `_parse_patient_meta`'s docstring for specifics.

    The mandatory per-page AI-disclosure footer text for this report.

    REVIEW STATE COMES FROM `document["review_status"]`, and from
    nothing else. That field is written only by
    `review/signoff.py::approve()` (`"reviewed"`) and `override()`
    (`"overridden"`); every other path leaves the `"draft"` that
    `report/json_builder.py` writes. Three outcomes, matching the three
    states the Markdown banner already distinguishes
    (`report/report_generator.py::_render_review_status_banner`):
    `"reviewed"` names the reviewer, `"overridden"` renders
    `_ICMR_OVERRIDDEN_FOOTER_TEXT`, and everything else -- `"draft"`, an
    unrecognised value, a missing key, or a missing `document` entirely
    -- renders `_ICMR_DRAFT_FOOTER_TEXT`. That last catch-all is the
    fail-safe direction: a report nobody has attested to reviewing must
    never look, at a glance, indistinguishable from one that is
    actually ready for clinical use.

    This deliberately reverses an earlier design in which
    `patient["physician"]` -- a free-text field supplied by the caller
    via `--patient-meta` -- was the sole signal for "has a clinician
    actually reviewed this run". That made the review claim assertable
    by an input file: supplying any physician string suppressed the
    DRAFT warning on every page and printed "has been reviewed by X",
    with no sign-off ever performed and `review_status` still `"draft"`.
    An input field must not be able to make the clinician-facing
    artefact assert something the sign-off record does not.

    `physician` therefore now means ATTRIBUTION ONLY -- the referring
    clinician, already rendered as "Referring Physician" in the patient
    identity block of both PDFs -- and no longer carries any review
    state. It survives here only as a fallback for the reviewer's NAME,
    and only once `review_status` has already established that a
    sign-off exists; it can no longer create that state on its own.

    The reviewer named is `document["reviewed_by"]`, which
    `approve()` writes alongside `review_status` from the same
    clinician/registration/hospital string it folds into `physician`
    (e.g. "Dr. A. Sharma, MD, Reg. No. 12345, ABC Diagnostics"), so the
    rendered sentence is unchanged for the normal sign-off path -- it
    is now simply sourced from the sign-off record rather than from an

    (type-validated field by field). It does NOT implement consent
    storage, an erasure/withdrawal workflow, an IP-address/hash audit
    trail, or any database -- those are real DPDP Act requirements, but
    belong to a much larger patient-intake/storage-lifecycle system
    that doesn't exist in GEPER yet and shouldn't be bolted on here
    speculatively. This is metadata capture only, not a compliance
    guarantee -- the actual consent process, its storage, and its
    retention remain the deploying lab's responsibility (same framing
    `_parse_patient_meta`'s own docstring already uses for
    patient_name/dob/gender/physician).

    Returns `None` -- never a fabricated `{"clinical_reporting": False,

    carry a genuine, documented consent record -- consent tracking and

    own default "de-identified / research sample" framing (see this
    module's own disclaimer text), the single most common case this
    field needs to cover.

    Each of `clinical_reporting`/`research` is independently `None`
    (not coerced to `False`) when that one field wasn't stated as an
    actual JSON boolean -- a stray string like `"true"` is a type
    mismatch, not evidence of consent either way, so it is treated as
    "not stated" rather than guessed. `timestamp` is passed through
    exactly as supplied (GEPER never fabricates a "when consent was

    parse failure is logged for operators; it is deliberately NOT
    surfaced in the rendered report itself (a clinical document should
    show the safe fallback state, not internal parsing diagnostics).

    `consent` and `physician`: resolved regardless of whether
    `patient_name` was usable, so both are computed before the name-gate
    below and threaded into both the de-identified and named return
    shapes. Two independent reasons this matters, one per field:

      - `consent` (see `_parse_consent`'s docstring): consent tracking
        is independent of patient identification -- a de-identified
        research sample can still carry a real, documented consent
        record.
      - `physician`: REVIEWING-CLINICIAN identity is a different
        concern from PATIENT identity. GEPER's stated default is a
        de-identified/research sample (see this module's own
        disclaimer text) -- that must remain the common case a lab can
        stay in while still having a named clinician review and sign
        off on a report (see `_icmr_ai_disclosure_footer_text`, which
        NAMES this field as the reviewer once `document["review_status"]`
        has already established that the report is reviewed).
        CORRECTED 2026-09-11 -- this sentence previously read: "which
        reads exactly this field to decide \"DRAFT\" vs \"reviewed by
        {physician}\"". That describes the design this codebase
        DELIBERATELY REVERSED on 2026-08-21, and it described it as
        current: when `physician` decided the DRAFT banner, an input
        file could assert a review that no sign-off had performed.
        `_icmr_ai_disclosure_footer_text`'s own docstring, ~170 lines
        above in this same file, has said since then that review state
        comes from `document["review_status"]` "and from nothing else"
        and that `physician` is "ATTRIBUTION ONLY". A caveat corrected
        in one place and left standing in another is worse than an
        uncorrected one, because the corrected copy is a reader's
        evidence that someone checked. Coupling `physician` to `patient_name` would
        force a lab to fabricate or attach a real patient name purely
        to unlock sign-off on an otherwise-intentionally-de-identified
        run -- backwards from what de-identification is for. (Earlier
        versions of this function dropped `physician` in the de-
        identified branch, matching every other identity field; that
        turned out to be wrong for exactly this reason once a real
        sign-off workflow needed to depend on it -- see
        `geper/review/signoff.py`'s `approve` command.)

    India DPDP Act 2023 note (not HIPAA/GDPR -- this is an India-market
    product): patient_name/dob/gender/physician are "personal data"
    under the DPDP Act once a real (non-de-identified) patient_meta is
    supplied. This function only parses and hands back what it is
    given -- it does not implement or enforce the DPDP Act's consent
    capture, purpose-limitation, data-minimization, or retention/
    deletion requirements, none of which can be satisfied inside a PDF
    renderer; those belong further upstream (the system that collects
    and stores patient_meta in the first place). Real compliance
    sign-off must come from someone qualified to review the full data
    flow against DPDP Act requirements before production/hospital
    deployment -- do not treat this comment, or the presence of a

    known) before actually emitting it.

    This composes with `SimpleDocTemplate.build(onFirstPage=...,

class _Bookmark(Flowable):
    """
    A zero-size flowable that, when the document layout engine reaches it
    in the normal top-to-bottom flow, marks the current page as the
    target of a named PDF bookmark and adds a matching entry to the PDF's
    outline (the navigation panel most PDF viewers show in a sidebar).

    This is the standard ReportLab/Platypus recipe for outline entries --
    `Canvas.bookmarkPage`/`Canvas.addOutlineEntry` are canvas-level calls,
    and a flowable's `draw()` is the only place in Platypus's flowable
    API that has the live canvas for the exact page this content actually
    lands on (which page that turns out to be depends on everything laid
    out before it, so it cannot be known any earlier). `width`/`height`
    are both 0 so inserting this never shifts any surrounding layout --
    it occupies no visible space itself.

    Compatible with `_NumberedCanvas`'s two-pass buffering (`showPage`
    snapshots `self.__dict__`, `save` replays it) because `bookmarkPage`/
    `addOutlineEntry` mutate the canvas's underlying PDF document object
    directly, not the per-page graphics-state attributes that trick
    snapshots and restores -- the same reason page content itself
    survives that buffering unaffected.

    `key` must be unique across the whole document; `title` is the
    (non-unique) label shown in the outline; `level` follows
    `addOutlineEntry`'s own rule (may repeat or drop to any shallower
    level freely, but may only go one level deeper than the last entry
    at a time) -- see that method's docstring for the full rule.

    Why this matters for sizing: an icon-style logo is routinely saved
    on a much larger transparent canvas than the mark itself (GEPER's
    own `assets/logo.png` is a 500x500 canvas whose visible content is
    only ~213px tall, roughly 43% of the canvas height). Sizing a
    bounding box that includes that invisible padding to "match the
    title's height" (as an earlier version of this function did)
    therefore actually renders the *visible* mark at well under half
    that height -- which is exactly the "tiny icon" bug this was
    written to fix. Cropping first means the height this module
    computes always corresponds to what a viewer actually sees, for
    GEPER's own mark or any white-label logo a hospital supplies,
    regardless of how much padding its source file happens to carry.

    Returns the original image bytes unchanged (still as a BytesIO, so
    the caller has one consistent input type) when there is no alpha
    channel, or when the alpha channel's bounding box can't be

    document flow alongside the title text exactly like the Sample ID/
    Run ID table and disclaimer that follow it, and it never repeats
    on later pages simply because it is only ever added once, at the
    top of the story: `SimpleDocTemplate` always starts the story at
    the top of page 1, so "first page only" falls out of that
    placement for free, without any page-number bookkeeping.

    measured height (`title.wrap(...)`, at the full content width so
    it's measured as the single line it actually renders as) -- not a

    The logo is cropped to its visible content first (see
    `_load_cropped_logo_image`) so that measured height corresponds to
    what's actually visible, not an oversized transparent canvas.
    Width is always derived from the (cropped) image's own aspect
    ratio, so a non-square white-label logo is never stretched.

    Never raises. A missing file, an unreadable path, a corrupt image,

    omitted -- a missing section used to be indistinguishable from a

    exactly the "absence of the section is indistinguishable from
    absence of the query" failure mode this report works to eliminate
    elsewhere. In real pipeline operation the 1000 Genomes SAS stage
    always runs, so the explicit not-queried branches below are the
    honest fallback for the cases where a caller genuinely didn't wire

    an authoring scientist plus an authorising consultant). Previously

    keys: geper_version, generated_at, input_vcf, assembly, vcf_samples,
    variant_count, variants[]) as a clinical-grade, multi-page PDF.

    A single variant_result dict (one entry of `document["variants"]`,
    e.g. for ad hoc testing against one already-annotated variant) is
    also accepted directly -- detected by the absence of a "variants"
    key alongside the presence of a "variant" key.

    `patient_meta`: dict, path to a JSON file, or None -- see
    `_parse_patient_meta`'s docstring for the DPDP Act framing and
    de-identified fallback.
    Run-level QC is NOT a parameter: it is read from
    `document["qc_metrics"]` by `_document_qc_metrics`. See
    `_parse_qc_metrics`'s docstring for the three-state (found/not
    applicable/failed) shape each of "mean_coverage_depth",
    "bases_at_20x", "q30_score" is validated into, and
    `config.py::QCReportConfig`'s docstring for why GEPER cannot
    compute these itself from a VCF-only pipeline. `bridge/
    combined_pipeline.py` is the reference producer of this file when
    kim_pipeline supplied the upstream FASTQ->BAM run.
    `run_id`: optional caller-supplied run/accession identifier; see
    `_derive_run_id`'s docstring for the fallback when not given.
    `logo_path`: optional per-call override for the header logo image
    (any format ReportLab/PIL can decode -- PNG-with-alpha is the
    common case). None (the default) defers to
    `CONFIG.report_branding` (GEPER's own default mark, or a
    white-label deployment's, via GEPER_REPORT_LOGO_PATH /
    GEPER_REPORT_LOGO_ENABLED); pass "" explicitly to force no logo
    for just this call regardless of that config. See
    `_build_report_header`'s docstring for the placement (first page
    only, alongside the title, never a watermark) and the graceful
    fallback when the file is missing or fails to load.

    Raises on a genuine ReportLab rendering failure (unlike every other
    optional-evidence integration in this codebase, which degrades
    gracefully) -- silently emitting a corrupt/truncated PDF would be
    worse than a loud failure for a document a hospital will file.
    `patient_meta` parsing failures and logo load failures are the
    things this function swallows (see `_parse_patient_meta` and
    `_build_report_header`), per spec.
