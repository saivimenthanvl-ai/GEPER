─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
w153 (WAVE 3) — THE FIRST-ADMINISTRATOR BOOTSTRAP, and what stops it being a
permanent bypass.

WHAT AUTHORISES THIS, SAID FIRST, BECAUSE THE WAVE IS ALLOWED TO BE A STOP.
`clinical/bootstrap.py` is NOT the mechanism and this file does not use it:
read rather than inferred from its name, it creates the two POSTGRES LOGIN
ROLES (`clinical_app`, `clinical_retention`) that `schema.sql` grants to, and
optionally applies `schema.sql`. It writes no `organisations` row, no `users`
row and no `role_assignments` row, and it knows nothing about application
principals. It is a DATABASE bootstrap, not an IDENTITY one.

The authorised mechanism is the human's own w128 ruling
(`hive/agents/god/briefs/w128-provisioning.md`), which specifies exactly this
operation — "organisation row → first user → first Administrator role
assignment, **in one transaction**", session-free "because it is called before
any session can exist", operator-run, and with **no HTTP route**. This file is
that ruling's required tests plus the three Wave 3 adds: a positive twin that
goes all the way through a WAVE 2 ROUTE, the inertness proof, and the
structural guard that keeps the method off every served surface.

─── WHAT MAKES IT INERT ONCE AN ADMINISTRATOR EXISTS ───

Not a flag. Three structural facts, each proved from the database or the
syntax tree rather than from anything a caller supplies:

  1. IT CANNOT NAME AN ORGANISATION THAT ALREADY EXISTS. `org_id` is
     `uuid.uuid4()` in the method body and there is NO parameter of any kind
     by which a caller could name an existing one. So for every organisation
     that already has its Administrator, this method is a no-op it cannot
     address — the house "defence by absent parameter" pattern, the same one
     `terminate_my_session` and `list_my_report_trend` use, where the wrong
     version is UNWRITABLE rather than merely refused.
  2. IT CANNOT GRANT ANY ROLE BUT `'Administrator'`. The role is a SQL
     LITERAL, not a parameter, so `'System'` — which w141 made unassignable
     to people — cannot be reached through it either.
  3. IT IS ON NO SERVED SURFACE. No route in either app reaches it; the only
     caller is an operator who already holds the database credential and who
     could therefore already write these three rows by hand. That is the
     whole reason this is not a privilege escalation: it grants nobody any
     capability they did not already have, and converts an out-of-band raw
     INSERT (which twenty-six test files carry) into one audited atomic act.

A SECOND CALL IS NOT "REFUSED", AND SAYING SO WOULD BE FALSE. It creates a
SECOND, DIFFERENT organisation with that organisation's own first
Administrator — which is the spec's single-instance multi-organisation
tenancy (§4.2), not a bypass. What is refused is the only thing that would be
a bypass: reaching an EXISTING organisation. `TestItCannotBeRepeatedAgainstAn
OrganisationThatAlreadyHasAnAdministrator` proves that with the same name and
the same administrator email, and reads the first organisation back THROUGH
THE DOMAIN METHODS to show it is untouched.

─── THE MEASURED HAZARD THIS FILE IS SHAPED AROUND ───

`@auditable` CALLS `commit()` ITSELF after writing each audit row, OUTSIDE
`@transactional`'s `_in_transaction` re-entrancy guard. So a
`provision_organisation` COMPOSED out of the already-decorated
`create_organisation` and `create_user` would have each inner wrapper commit
mid-way and atomicity would be silently gone: a failure at the role step would
leave a committed organisation and a committed user with NO ADMINISTRATOR —
the exact unusable state the method exists to prevent.

THE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY, stated: `@transactional` on
`provision_organisation` itself. `@auditable` is the OUTER decorator, so on an
unexpected exception `@transactional` has already ROLLED BACK before
`@auditable`'s error branch writes and commits its row. The data goes; the
evidence stays. `TestAFailureAtTheLastStepLeavesNothing` forces the failure at
step three and reads back through the domain methods.

─── THE WRONG-FIRST LIST, AND WHICH ROW CATCHES EACH ───

(A) A BOOTSTRAP THAT CAN RUN AGAIN ONCE AN ADMINISTRATOR EXISTS — i.e. one
    that accepts an `org_id` and adds a second Administrator to a live tenant.
    Caught by `TestItCannotBeRepeatedAgainstAnOrganisationThatAlreadyHasAn
    Administrator` behaviourally and by
    `test_it_accepts_no_organisation_identifier_of_any_kind` structurally.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a mechanism that never works at all — which is why
    `TestTheBootstrapProducesAWorkingAdministrator` comes first in this file.

(B) ONE WHOSE "ALREADY BOOTSTRAPPED" CHECK READS A CALLER-SUPPLIED VALUE —
    an `if already_bootstrapped:` parameter, or a check against a name or an
    email the caller chose.
    Caught by `test_the_organisation_id_is_generated_in_the_body_not_supplied`
    (AST: the `org_id` bound into all three INSERTs is assigned from
    `uuid.uuid4()` inside the method) and by the second half of (A)'s
    behavioural row, which passes the SAME name and SAME email twice and still
    gets a fresh tenant rather than a refusal or a reuse.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a caller-supplied value used for something OTHER than the
    bootstrapped check — the signature row covers the parameter list itself.

(C) ONE THAT CREATES THE ADMINISTRATOR BUT WHOSE AUDIT ROW NAMES NO ACTOR OR
    THE WRONG ORGANISATION.
    Caught by `TestTheAuditRowIsHonestAboutItsMissingActor`, which pins
    org_id = the NEW organisation, resource_id = the new org_id, and asserts
    the NULL actor EXISTS and that `operating_context` compensates for it in
    the existing `details` JSONB. The NULL actor is the human's ruled and
    accepted cost, not a defect this wave may fix: there is no principal to
    name, and a `created_by` column was considered and recommended against
    for exactly that reason.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: an audit row written but never committed — the error-path
    row in `TestAFailureAtTheLastStepLeavesNothing` covers the commit.

(D) ONE WHERE A FAILURE AT THE FINAL STEP LEAVES THE ORGANISATION OR THE USER
    BEHIND.
    Caught by `TestAFailureAtTheLastStepLeavesNothing`, which reads back
    through `login` and `get_user` — domain methods, Standing Rule 2a — and
    is paired with the positive twin that the identical call without the
    injected failure creates all three rows.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a method that creates nothing; the positive twin is the
    pairing Standing Rule 4 requires.

(E) GRANTING `'System'` TO A HUMAN PRINCIPAL.
    Caught by `TestItGrantsAdministratorAndNothingElse`: the role is proved to
    be a SQL literal with no parameter behind it (AST), the provisioned user's
    role set read back through `get_user_roles` is exactly
    `["Administrator"]`, and no `'System'` assignment exists anywhere after
    provisioning.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a later caller granting System through `assign_role` —
    w141's own suite owns that, and this file does not restate it.
