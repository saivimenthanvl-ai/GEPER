clinical/tests/test_w152_admin_surface.py
──────────────────────────────────────────
w152 (WAVE 2) — the administrative HTTP surface, tested as BEHAVIOUR through
the app the service actually serves (`clinical.app`), never a test-local
stand-in and never by reading source alone.

THE FOUR ROUTES UNDER TEST, each one existing domain method:

    POST /admin/users/{user_id}/roles                    assign_role
    POST /admin/users/{user_id}/disabled                 set_user_disabled
    POST /admin/patient-logins/{id}/disabled             set_patient_login_disabled
    GET  /admin/audit                                    read_audit

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE, SAID FIRST SO NOTHING HERE IS MISREAD.
It does NOT prove these routes are reachable by a real deployment. They are
not. Every one of them requires an Administrator or an Auditor session, and
at `e1be7ab` nothing in production can make the first Administrator —
`assign_role` is the only production writer of a human role assignment and it
requires an existing Administrator. The Administrator below is provisioned by
INSERTING THE ROLE ROW DIRECTLY, exactly as `test_identity.py::admin_session`
and `test_w133_staff_revocation.py::_staff_session` already do. That is a
FIXTURE, not a bootstrap, and no bootstrap was invented to make these rows
pass: inventing one would be Wave 3's work done badly and would become a
permanent part of the product. These routes are IMPLEMENTED + UNREACHABLE.

─── THE TWO MEASURED HAZARDS THIS FILE IS SHAPED AROUND ───

1. A REFUSAL ROW THAT ASSERTS ONLY "IT FAILED" IS GREEN AGAINST BROKEN CODE.
   w149's cross-organisation row had to assert the SQLSTATE *and* the
   constraint name, because the pre-fix code failed for the wrong reason.
   So every refusal row here asserts WHY: the exact (status, body) pair, as a
   SET OF SIZE ONE across every case in its class (Standing Rule 8 — an
   oracle can live in either channel, so both are pinned, together). And
   every refusal is paired with a POSITIVE TWIN the broken state fails: the
   same request, from the right principal, succeeding.

2. A MISSING PREDICATE IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY BEHAVIOURAL ROW WHEN
   IDENTIFIERS CANNOT COLLIDE BY ACCIDENT (w148). Two random UUIDs never
   collide, so a handler that dropped the organisation predicate would pass
   every test that only ever names ids from its own tenant.
   `TestTheCrossOrganisationCallIsRefused` therefore CONSTRUCTS THE COLLISION:
   a real user and a real patient credential are planted in organisation B,
   their real ids are named from an organisation A session, and the rows in B
   are then read back and proved UNCHANGED. Without those planted rows this
   whole file is vacuous about tenancy.

─── THE WRONG-FIRST LIST, AND WHICH ROW CATCHES EACH ───

(A) THE ORGANISATION TAKEN FROM THE REQUEST rather than the principal.
    Caught by `TestNoCallerControlledOrganisationEscape` — the query-string
    row (a supplied `org_id` is ignored and the write lands in the session's
    organisation, proved by reading org A's roles and org B's), the body row
    (`extra="forbid"` refuses the field outright), and the structural row
    (no route signature and no request model on this surface mentions an
    organisation at all).
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a handler that reads the organisation from the session
    and then fails to pass it down — the domain method binds it, so that
    version cannot exist here. `TestTheCrossOrganisationCallIsRefused` is
    what covers the predicate itself.

(B) AUTHENTICATION ENFORCED BUT AUTHORISATION NOT.
    Caught by `TestTheWrongRoleIsRefused`: an authenticated Orderer, holding
    a real live session in the right organisation, is refused on all four
    routes, and the write is then proved NOT to have happened.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a route with no authentication at all —
    `TestTheUnauthenticatedCallIsRefused` is that row.

(C) A 404-VERSUS-403 DISTINCTION THAT REVEALS CROSS-TENANT EXISTENCE.
    Caught by `TestTheRefusalsCarryNoOracle`, which asserts the 404 set is
    size one over {malformed id, id that exists nowhere, REAL id in the other
    organisation} and the 403 set is size one over those same three targets.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a leak that is not in the refusal — e.g. a 200 that
    returned another tenant's row. `TestTheCrossOrganisationCallIsRefused`
    reads the other tenant's rows back to cover that.

(D) THE AUDIT ROW WRITTEN OUTSIDE THE OPERATION'S TRANSACTION — the
    `@auditable` composition hazard: the decorator COMMITS after each audit
    row, so an operation assembled out of two decorated calls commits the
    first half's audit row when the second half fails.
    Caught by `TestTheHandlersComposeNoDecoratedCalls`: every handler makes
    EXACTLY ONE call on the `DataAccess` instance, read from the AST, with a
    positive twin proving the analyser sees a second call when one exists.
    Paired behaviourally by `TestTheFailedWriteLeavesNothing`.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a composition inside the DOMAIN layer — not this wave's
    surface, and already pinned by w133's own atomicity rows.

(E) BUSINESS LOGIC REIMPLEMENTED IN THE HANDLER rather than calling the
    domain method.
    Caught by `TestTheHandlersDoNotReimplementTheDomain`: no SQL, no
    `_require_role`, no role vocabulary and no organisation predicate appear
    anywhere in `clinical/admin_endpoints.py`, and each handler is proved to
    call its own domain method by name.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a handler that calls the right method with the wrong
    arguments — every behavioural row above covers that.
