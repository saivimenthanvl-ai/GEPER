WAVE 7, AND THE FIRST THING IT DID WAS MEASURE THE CHAIN.

The wave's subject is `Order -> Sample -> Processing -> QC -> Interpretation
-> Review -> Report`, and the instruction is to wire what is implemented but
unreachable, to STOP what needs a product decision, and above all NOT to build
a second state machine beside the existing one.

MEASURED AT `w126m-migrations` TIP `764d646`, by an ALIAS-RESOLVING `ast.Call`
census over every non-test module in the repository. Three instruments were
wrong before this one and each was wrong in a way that flattered the code:

  * grep credits a DOCSTRING as a caller. That is how `_release_report` came
    to be recorded with thirteen callers and zero calls.
  * a bare-name `ast.Call` census misses `from review.signoff import approve
    as _approve` followed by `_approve(...)`. It reported the Review stage as
    having no entry point when it has a CLI one.
  * naive `app.routes` iteration reports a surface of TWO on this stack,
    because `include_router` leaves an opaque `_IncludedRouter` wrapper.

The census used here resolves import aliases, counts only `ast.Call` nodes,
walks the route tree into the wrappers, and carries a NON-VACUITY CONTROL in
every direction — a needle it must find, or the instrument is broken rather
than the claim proved. `TestThePremiseThisWaveMeasured` reproduces it as rows,
so the measurement cannot decay into prose.

WHAT IT FOUND, AND IT IS THE REASON THIS FILE IS SMALL AND THE REPORT IS LONG:

  Order          create_order / place_order / cancel_order   0 callers, 0 routes
  Sample         receive_sample                              0 callers, 0 routes
  Processing     create_sequencing_run / create_vcf          0 callers, 0 routes
                 record_pipeline_result                      1 caller  (worker)
  QC             record_qc                                   0 callers, 0 routes
  Interpretation create_interpretation / create_report       0 callers, 0 routes
  Review         submit_for_review / approve_report          1 caller  (review CLI)
  Report         _release_report / require_release           0 callers, 0 routes
                 retract_report                              1 caller  (w156 route)

TWO STAGES ARE WIRED HERE AND THE REST ARE CARDED. Sample and QC are pure
"make reachable": both domain methods are Lab-technician-gated, both enforce
the existing order/sample state rules themselves, both are audited, and both
vocabularies are enumerated IN THE SCHEMA, so nothing below decides anything.

RELEASE IS NOT WIRED, AND THAT IS THIS WAVE'S LOAD-BEARING REFUSAL.
`_release_report` still has zero production call sites — re-verified here, as
a row, with a control needle. So `/portal/me/reports`,
`/portal/me/reports/{report_id}` and `/portal/me/trends` still return empty
for every patient for ever, and w156's retraction verb still acts on a state
nothing in production can produce. WHO may release and FROM WHICH STATE are
derivable and already encoded (Approver on the session and on `released_by`,
from `approved` or `released`). The `consumer` is NOT, and the tree says so
itself, in `schema.sql`'s comment on that very column: "Free text pending the
delivery paths of a later commit; enumerating it now would fix a vocabulary
before the paths exist." Spec 13.4 describes release as an event a DELIVERY
PATH records and names no route; there is no delivery path in this backend.
STOPPED AND CARDED rather than settled by accident.
`TestTheReleaseGapIsStillOpen` is the tripwire that keeps that honest in both
directions: it fails if release quietly acquires a caller AND it fails if the
schema comment that grounds the refusal disappears.

THE FIVE WRONG-FIRST ROWS, AND WHAT EACH CATCHES AND IS VACUOUS AGAINST —
stated per row in its own docstring, and summarised here:

  (A) NO ROLE. `TestOnlyALabTechnicianMayWorkTheBench` — the five non-Lab-
      technician principals get ONE refusal. Catches a handler that forgot the
      gate or a domain method whose `_require_role` moved below a read.
      Vacuous against a gate that names the WRONG role but still refuses
      everyone — which row (A2) covers by requiring the Lab technician to
      SUCCEED.
  (B) CROSS-ORGANISATION. `TestTheCrossOrganisationTransitionIsRefused` —
      organisation B holds a REAL placed order and a REAL received sample
      whose identifiers organisation A names. Catches a dropped `org_id`
      predicate. Vacuous WITHOUT the planted rows, because two random UUIDs
      never collide (hazard 3), which is why they are constructed.
  (C) AUDIT. `TestTheAuditRowNamesTheRightActorOrganisationAndSpecimen` —
      the row must exist, name the acting Lab technician and their own
      organisation, and CARRY THE SPECIMEN TYPE. Catches a transition that
      lands with no audit row, one attributed to the target's tenant, and the
      `params.get("type")` defect this wave found and fixed. Vacuous against a
      row whose details are merely PRESENT, which is why the type is asserted
      by VALUE against the value sent.
  (D) STATE-MACHINE BYPASS. `TestTheExistingStateMachineIsNotDuplicated` —
      the handler modules contain no SQL and no `orders` write of any kind,
      by syntax tree; the `placed -> sample_awaited` advance is performed by
      the domain method and observed through `get_order`. Catches a handler
      that wrote the end state directly. Vacuous against a handler that writes
      state through a helper in another module, which the "exactly one
      decorated call" row covers from the other side.
  (E) FORBIDDEN SOURCE STATE. `TestATransitionFromAForbiddenStateIsRefused` —
      a DRAFT order and a CANCELLED order cannot receive a specimen, and the
      refusal SAYS WHY. Catches a wired route that skipped the state check.
      Vacuous against a 400 that refuses everything, which the positive twin
      on the placed order catches.

THE SIX MEASURED HAZARDS, AND WHERE EACH IS ANSWERED:
  1. `@auditable` has no `functools.wraps`, so `inspect.signature` answers
     `(self, *args, **kwargs)`. EVERY structural claim here reads the SYNTAX
     TREE, and `_first_role_gate`'s non-vacuity twin lives in w135.
  2. A refusal asserting only "it failed" is green against broken code — so
     every refusal row asserts the PAIR (status, raw body bytes), and the two
     400s assert the RULE they name, not merely their status.
  3. Construct the collision — organisation B holds a real placed order and a
     real sample. Without them a missing org predicate is invisible.
  4. Refusal order leaks — refusals are asserted as SETS OF SIZE ONE, never
     pairwise.
  5. Validation order leaks — `TestTheGateRunsBeforeAnyVocabularyOrFormatCheck`
     sends an unknown sample type, an unknown QC verdict and a malformed
     identifier as a non-Lab-technician and requires the SAME 403 as a
     well-formed body. Its twin proves a Lab technician CAN tell them apart.
  6. A substring scan credits prose — no claim here about a definition, a
     caller, a parameter or a route is made with `in source`. The one place a
     substring IS used (the schema comment tripwire) is asserting the presence
     of PROSE, which is the only thing a substring scan is right for.
