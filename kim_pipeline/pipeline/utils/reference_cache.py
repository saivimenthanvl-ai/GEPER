──────────────────────────────────
Reference-genome preparation and BWA index caching.

Written to fix a specific, profiled bottleneck: BWA indexing of a large
(hundreds-of-MB to multi-GB) reference genome inside an ephemeral notebook
environment (Google Colab), where:

  1. The reference is often a plain ``.gz`` file.
  2. `/content` is wiped whenever the runtime disconnects/expires, so an
     index built there is lost even if the build itself succeeded.
  3. `bwa index` gives no visible progress for long stretches, and the
     pipeline's own subprocess helper (`pipeline/fastq/errors.py::_run`)
     buffers all stdout/stderr until the process exits — so a multi-hour
     build looks identical to a hang from the notebook's point of view.

What this module does NOT do: change which aligner is used, or guess at
speedups that weren't actually measured. See `docs/BWA_INDEXING.md` (added
alongside this module) for the profiling results that justify each design
choice below.

Two independent caches, because they solve two different problems:

  * `resolve_reference()` — decompresses a `.gz` reference exactly once
    into a local, fast working directory. This is NOT primarily a speed
    optimization (profiling showed `bwa index` runs at effectively the
    same speed against a `.gz` input as a decompressed one — gzip
    decompression is a small fraction of total index-build time). It
    exists because a downstream stage in this same pipeline
    (`variant_calling/freebayes_runner.py`, via `samtools faidx`) cannot
    open a plain-gzip FASTA at all (samtools requires either an
    uncompressed FASTA or *bgzip*-compressed, not standard gzip) — so a
    `.gz` reference must be decompressed somewhere before the pipeline
    can complete regardless of alignment-stage speed.

  * `ensure_bwa_index()` — builds the BWA FM-index into a *persistent*,
    configurable directory (e.g. a Google Drive mount) using an
    atomic build-then-publish pattern, so:
      - a completed index is *never* rebuilt on a later run (fixes the
        "1-2 hours every single time" complaint), and
      - a build interrupted by a Colab session timeout can *never* be
        mistaken for a complete, valid index on the next run (existing
        code only checked file *existence*, not completeness -- a
        session that dies while BWA is still writing `.sa` would leave
        all 5 suffix files present on disk, and the old existence-only
        check would wrongly treat that as "already indexed").
