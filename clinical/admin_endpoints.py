w152 (WAVE 2) — THE ADMINISTRATIVE HTTP SURFACE. The outermost layer, which
is the one that was missing.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, STATED AS THE MEASUREMENT AND NOT AS A STORY.
`w150-reachability-audit.md` counted fourteen unreachable capabilities and
found that in thirteen of them the broken link is the SAME one and it is the
outermost: no HTTP route and no CLI command. Not one of them is "a route
exists but nothing calls the domain method". Re-measured at `e1be7ab` by AST
(`ast.Call` nodes in production files, never grep — grep credits a docstring
as a caller, which is how `_release_report` came to be recorded as having
thirteen callers and zero calls): `assign_role`, `set_user_disabled`,
`set_patient_login_disabled` and `read_audit` each have ZERO production call
sites, and the seventeen production routes contain ZERO administrative ones.

So this is ONE MISSING SURFACE, not fourteen wiring problems, and this module
is that surface.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT IN IT.
Every handler below is a TRANSLATION — HTTP in, one existing domain method,
HTTP out. There is no business logic here, no second permission system, no
second session type, no second refusal vocabulary and no SQL. The role gate
is `DataAccess._require_role`, called from inside the domain method's own
body, exactly where it already was; this file never asks what roles a caller
holds and never decides. A handler that made that decision itself would be a
second authorisation system whose answer could drift from the first one's,
and the first one is the one the database's composite foreign keys back up.

Four capabilities were wired at w152, a fifth (role revocation) at w154, and
a sixth (patient credential issuance) at w155. The rest are NOT, each for a
stated reason, and the reasons are in `WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE` at the
bottom of this docstring. A capability that needs a product decision is
stopped and carded rather than guessed.

w155 (WAVE 5) — TWO SHAPES OF ROUTE, AND WHICH ONE THE NEW ONE IS.
The requirement "a patient ID never comes from an unauthenticated public
request as authority" is met in this repository by TWO different mechanisms
and it matters which is which:

  DEFENCE BY ABSENT PARAMETER — the portal. `list_my_report_trend(self,
  patient_session)` takes NO patient identifier, so the wrong version is
  UNWRITABLE rather than merely untested. Every `/portal/` route is this
  shape and none of them may ever stop being it.

  AN AUTHENTICATED ADMINISTRATOR NAMING A TARGET — this surface, including
  `POST /admin/patients/{patient_id}/logins`. Administration is by definition
  acting on somebody else, so the identifier is in the path. It is not an
  authority claim and cannot become one: the caller is authenticated as
  STAFF, the ORGANISATION the identifier is resolved in comes from
  `Session.org_id` and never from the request, and the role gate runs before
  the identifier is read at all. A `patient_id` here selects a row WITHIN the
  caller's own tenant; it never selects an identity, and it never selects a
  tenant.

The one shape that exists nowhere is the third: an UNAUTHENTICATED request
carrying a patient identifier. There is no self-registration route, and
`test_w155_patient_administration.py` proves it by enumerating the served
surface rather than by asserting it.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE SECURITY MODEL, IN THE ORDER A REQUEST MEETS IT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. AUTHENTICATION — `Depends(_get_session)`, imported from
   `clinical/endpoints.py` and NOT reimplemented. It is the same dependency
   the exception routes use: `_presented_session_id` reads the cookie or the
   bearer header and shape-checks it while touching no database, then
   `DataAccess.session_valid` validates it. Every failure — absent, malformed,
   unknown, expired, terminated, or a PATIENT session id presented to a staff
   route — is `_anonymous_refusal()`: 401, `GENERIC_AUTH_ERROR`, byte for
   byte. There is no route on this router without that dependency, and
   `test_w152_admin_surface.py` proves that by enumerating the router rather
   than by reading it.

2. ORGANISATION CONTEXT — DERIVED, NEVER SUPPLIED. `Session.org_id` comes
   out of the `sessions` row. Not one route below accepts an organisation in
   a path segment, a query parameter or a body field, and the request models
   set `extra="forbid"` so that a body which tries to carry one is REFUSED
   rather than silently ignored — a silent ignore is correct today and is one
   careless `**body` away from not being.

   THE HOUSE PATTERN IS DEFENCE BY ABSENT PARAMETER and it is preferred
   wherever it is expressible: `list_my_report_trend(self, patient_session)`
   takes no patient identifier, so the wrong version is UNWRITABLE. An
   administrative route cannot be quite that shape — administration is by
   definition acting on somebody else — so the weaker form is used and it is
   the same rule one level down: the caller may name a TARGET, and the
   ORGANISATION that target is looked up in comes from the principal. Every
   domain method below binds `org_id = session.org_id` in its own SQL, and
   the schema's composite foreign keys refuse the row even if that layer were
   wrong.

3. ROLE AUTHORISATION — `_require_role`, inside the domain method, FIRST.
   Administrator for the three writes, Auditor for the audit read. The order
   is load-bearing and it is the domain layer's, not this file's:
   `assign_role`'s own docstring says "THE ORDER MATTERS: the Administrator
   check stays FIRST, so a caller without it learns nothing about which roles
   are assignable". Because the gate precedes every target read, a 403 from
   this surface is a function of the CALLER'S ROLES ALONE and carries no
   information whatever about whether the named target exists.

4. AUDIT ATTRIBUTION — `@auditable` on the domain method, unchanged and
   untouched. The actor is `session.user_id`, the organisation is
   `session.org_id`, the target is the `resource_id_param` the decorator
   already names. Nothing in this file writes an audit row.

   AND NOTHING IN THIS FILE COMPOSES TWO DECORATED METHODS INTO ONE
   OPERATION. `@auditable` COMMITS after each audit row it writes, so a
   handler assembled out of "check it, then do it" would commit the first
   half's audit row when the second half failed — an audit that records
   something that did not happen. Each handler calls EXACTLY ONE decorated
   domain method, which is why, for example, the disable routes do not
   read the user back to return it.

5. ERROR MODEL — THREE REFUSALS, EACH A SET OF SIZE ONE ACROSS THE WHOLE
   SURFACE. The precedent is `clinical/portal_endpoints.py`, whose refusals
   are one object, and `clinical/endpoints.py::_anonymous_refusal`, whose
   docstring explains why a per-case equality is not enough (Standing Rule 8:
   an oracle can live in the STATUS channel or the BODY channel, so both are
   pinned, as a set).

       401 + GENERIC_AUTH_ERROR   not authenticated, in any of its six ways
       403 + ADMIN_FORBIDDEN      authenticated, lacks the required role
       404 + ADMIN_NOT_FOUND      no such target IN THIS ORGANISATION

   `ADMIN_FORBIDDEN` and `ADMIN_NOT_FOUND` are module constants and are the
   same string on every route, so a caller cannot tell from a refusal WHICH
   administrative object it named, nor which role it was short of.

   THE SURFACE ALSO ANSWERS 400, 409 AND 422, AND NONE OF THE THREE IS AN
   IDENTIFIER CHANNEL. 400 is the role vocabulary (a closed public list of
   seven strings), raised after the gate. 422 is a request SHAPE refusal
   (a forbidden extra field, a missing one, a `limit` out of range) and is
   the one refusal FastAPI answers BEFORE the handler runs — which is why no
   route on this surface may ever put a VALUE check in a request model.
   Hazard, measured this run: validation order leaks. An `EmailStr` or a
   `min_length` on the enrolment body would be answered to a caller holding
   no Administrator role at all, and the refusal would then vary with
   something evaluated before the caller's authorisation was. The enrolment
   model therefore declares `str` and `str` and checks neither.
   409 is `PatientAlreadyEnrolledError`, raised strictly after the
   Administrator gate AND after the patient-exists-in-this-organisation
   read, so it is visible only to an Administrator naming a patient in their
   own tenant. It varies with nothing outside that tenant.

6. NO INFORMATION ORACLE. The 404 is the same object for an identifier that
   is malformed, an identifier that exists nowhere, and an identifier that
   names a REAL ROW IN ANOTHER ORGANISATION. That last case is the one a
   behavioural test cannot reach by accident — two randomly generated UUIDs
   never collide — so `test_w152_admin_surface.py` CONSTRUCTS the collision:
   it plants a real user, and a real patient credential, in organisation B
   and names them from an organisation A session. Without that row a missing
   `org_id` predicate is invisible to every other test in the file.

   THE 403/404 DISTINCTION IS NOT AN ORACLE, and this is the reasoning rather
   than an assertion. A distinction leaks only if it varies with something the
   caller is not entitled to know. Here 403 depends on the caller's own roles
   and NOTHING else — the gate runs before any target is read, so a
   non-Administrator gets the identical 403 whether the target is real,
   invented, or in another tenant. And 404 depends on existence-within-the-
   caller's-own-organisation and nothing else. Neither varies with the
   existence of another tenant's row. Collapsing 403 into 404 as well would
   cost an Administrator any way to tell "I am not an Administrator" from "no
   such user" and buy nothing.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS SURFACE DOES NOT CLAIM — READ THIS BEFORE BELIEVING ANY OF IT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NO ROUTE IN THIS FILE IS REACHABLE BY A REAL DEPLOYMENT TODAY. Every one of
them requires a session holding Administrator or Auditor, and `assign_role`
is the only production writer of a human role assignment while itself
requiring an existing Administrator. A fresh deployment has none: measured at
`e1be7ab`, `INSERT INTO role_assignments` occurs at exactly two production
sites, one inside `assign_role` and one that writes `'System'`, which w141
made unassignable to people. That is the first-administrator deadlock and it
is WAVE 3's, not this wave's.

So these routes are IMPLEMENTED + UNREACHABLE, in the report's own
vocabulary, and they are classified that way rather than as complete. The
tests provision their Administrator BY INSERTING THE ROLE ROW DIRECTLY, the
same way `test_identity.py::admin_session` and
`test_w133_staff_revocation.py::_staff_session` already do — a FIXTURE, not
a bootstrap. No bootstrap was invented here to make this file's own tests
pass; inventing one would be doing Wave 3's work badly and would have to be a
permanent part of the product.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, AND WHY — each of these is a card, not an
oversight. See `hive/agents/god/w152-decision-cards.md`.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

* ORGANISATION CREATION (`create_organisation`) and STAFF CREATION
  (`create_user`). Both are `@auditable(requires_session=False)` and neither
  has a `_require_role` call anywhere in its body — AST-confirmed, not read
  off the docstring. A route onto either would therefore be an UNAUTHENTICATED
  route that creates a tenant or a principal, or it would need an
  authorisation rule invented at the HTTP layer, which is the second
  permission system this wave is forbidden to build. Which principal may
  create an organisation, and may create a user, is a product decision nobody
  has made. STOPPED.

* FIRST ADMINISTRATOR PROVISIONING. The deadlock above. WAVE 3.

* ROLE REVOCATION. ABSENT AT `e1be7ab`, WHERE THIS BULLET WAS WRITTEN, AND
  BUILT AT w154 (WAVE 4). The measurement that made it absent was right: no
  `DataAccess` method had `revoke` in its name and `revoked_at`/`revoked_by`
  appeared only in `revoked_at IS NULL` read predicates, so the enforcement
  model was continuous and strong and the state it enforced on had no writer.
  `DataAccess.revoke_role` is now that writer and `DELETE
  /admin/users/{user_id}/roles/{role}` is its route. It ends no sessions, and
  that is a measurement rather than an omission -- see the method's own
  docstring, and `revoke_role` below.

* PATIENT CREDENTIAL ISSUANCE (`enrol_patient_login`). STOPPED AT w152 AND
  WIRED AT w155 (WAVE 5). The w152 reasoning is left standing below in full,
  because it was right when it was written and because the thing that changed
  is not the code — it is the authority. READ BOTH HALVES.

  w152's ground, unedited: "Administrator-gated and audited, so it is
  mechanically pure wiring — and it is stopped anyway, on the one ground this
  wave is not allowed to resolve. `GEPER_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_SPEC.md` §16 reads
  '**Recommendation: no patient access in v1**', and carries an unanswered
  EXPERT call-out about what counselling provision must accompany patient
  access. Seven `/portal/` routes are nevertheless mounted and tested, and the
  tension is reported and unresolved. Issuing the credential is the act that
  converts that recommendation into a live patient-facing deployment — nothing
  else can, because there is no self-registration path of any kind. That is a
  product decision, and this wave does not silently reinterpret the product
  spec."

  WHAT SUPERSEDED IT. The human's Wave 5 dispatch instructs, in terms, "Wire
  patient enrolment and credential operations through the administrative
  surface", and sets eight requirements for it, the first being
  Administrator-only enrolment. A product decision that has been MADE is not
  the same object as one that is missing, and the thing w152 correctly refused
  to do — settle §16 BY IMPLEMENTATION — is not what w155 did: the ruling came
  first and from the person entitled to make it. `POST
  /admin/patients/{patient_id}/logins` is that wiring.

  AND THE TENSION IS RECORDED RATHER THAN DISSOLVED, WHICH IS THE PART A
  LATER READER NEEDS. §16 still says what it says. The EXPERT call-out about
  counselling provision is still unanswered. Seven `/portal/` routes and now
  one issuing route are mounted against a spec section that recommends against
  the whole surface, and the correct resolution is an edit to §16 by whoever
  owns it — not a further re-reading by an implementer. It is not reinterpreted
  here, in either direction. See `hive/agents/god/w155-decision-cards.md`.

  REVOCATION WAS WIRED BEFORE ISSUANCE WAS, and the asymmetry was the point
  rather than an inconsistency: revocation only ever CONTRACTS patient access
  and no citation anywhere opposes contracting it, while issuance expands it
  and §16 speaks directly to that. The safe half of a carded pair was not held
  hostage by the half that needed the ruling, and when the ruling came only
  the second half had to move.

* PATIENT RECORD CREATION AND CONSENT (`create_patient`, `record_consent`,
  `withdraw_consent`). STILL STOPPED AT w155, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS WHY.

  Re-measured at 60c48d9 by syntax tree, not grep: all three take a `Session`
  as their first parameter and bind `org_id` from it, all three are
  `@auditable(requires_session=True)`, and NONE of the three contains a
  `_require_role` call anywhere in its body. Production call sites: ZERO for
  each. Test call sites: 86, 57 and 6, across 43 files.

  So the gate CAN be added without breaking a single production caller —
  there are none. The question the gate cannot answer for itself is WHICH
  ROLE, and that is a product decision in the strict sense. "Administrator-only
  enrolment" is a ruling about ENROLMENT, and in this repository's own
  vocabulary enrolment is `enrol_patient_login` — the method named for it,
  whose audit action is `patient_login_enrolled`. `create_patient` is the
  clinical patient REGISTRATION that precedes an order, and `record_consent`
  is consent capture; making either Administrator-only would mean an
  Administrator must register every patient and capture every consent before
  any clinician can order a test. That is a workflow ruling with a cost, it is
  not what the dispatch said, and inventing it here would be exactly the
  "unresolved decision turned into an implementation assumption" the queue
  forbids. STOPPED and carded; no route is added onto any of the three, and
  none is gated, because a gate whose role is guessed is worse than a method
  with no HTTP surface.

  THE CONSEQUENCE IS HONEST AND IT IS STATED: the route this wave DOES add
  names a `patient_id`, and no route on this surface can create one. An
  Administrator enrolling a patient must be given a patient record that some
  other path made. That is the same class of gap as `provision_organisation`
  having no production caller outside `data_access.py` — the capability is
  IMPLEMENTED and the surface above it is not complete.

* PATIENT MFA. BLOCKED — a new security decision is required and none has been
  made. Re-verified at 60c48d9: `patient_logins` has no TOTP column of any
  kind and no patient code path mentions a second factor, so patient MFA is
  ABSENT rather than broken. Staff MFA is present and FAIL-CLOSED-BROKEN:
  `_verify_second_factor` raises `ConfigurationError` when `self._cipher` or
  `self._totp` is `None`, `enrol_totp` raises it too, and every production
  construction of `DataAccess` — `clinical/endpoints.py:262`,
  `geper/api/exception_retry_worker.py:132`, `geper/api/submission_worker.py:850`,
  `geper/review/signoff.py:936` — passes the connection alone, so both are
  always `None` in production. `enrol_totp` also takes the SECRET AS A
  PARAMETER, which means the caller generates it. Completing this needs a
  key-management ruling (where the cipher key lives and who rotates it), a
  secret-generation ruling, and for patients a schema change. No cryptography
  was invented here. See the card.

* EXCEPTION AMENDMENT and REPORT RETRACTION. `create_amendment` exists and is
  Approver-gated; the exception-amendment verb does not — `ExceptionEventAction`
  is still exactly open/resolve/reopen and `amends_event_id` has zero writers.
  `retract_report` does not exist at all: the `0003` schema landed and the
  domain method did not. WAVE 6, and one of them is ABSENT rather than
  unreachable.

    error, which makes "not a UUID" distinguishable from "a UUID that names
    nothing". That is a second refusal shape on a surface whose whole claim is

    THE EXACT INVERSE OF THE ROUTE ABOVE, on the same collection. `POST
    /users/{id}/roles` grants; `DELETE /users/{id}/roles/{role}` withdraws.

    THE ROLE IS A PATH SEGMENT AND NOT A BODY FIELD, which is why this route
    adds no request model. A role name is a member of a closed, public
    vocabulary of seven strings, not an identifier -- it names no row, leaks
    nothing by being in a URL, and there is nothing else to send. It is also
    what makes the request idempotent in the way DELETE is supposed to be:
    the second call withdraws nothing and says so.

    NO VOCABULARY CHECK HAPPENS HERE. An unknown role, and "System", are
    both refused by the domain method, after its Administrator gate, with the
    same `ValueError` shape `assign_role` already uses -- so a
    non-Administrator sending a nonsense role still gets the plain 403 and
    learns nothing about the vocabulary. Validating the segment here would
    put a second copy of the role list in this file and would answer before
    the gate.

    NOTHING IS DONE ABOUT THE TARGET'S LIVE SESSIONS, and it is deliberate.
    Roles are resolved per request: `Session` carries no role, `session_valid`
    reads only the `sessions` row, and `_require_role` re-reads
    `role_assignments` on every gated call. The target's next administrative
    request is refused by the gate itself. Ending their sessions would be a
    second mechanism for an effect the first one already has -- and it would
    also log them out of everything they are still entitled to do.

    w155 (WAVE 5). THE ISSUING HALF OF THE PAIR whose revoking half has been
    below since w152. The module docstring carries why the two arrived one
    wave apart and what superseded the stop; this docstring is about the
    route.

    THE SHAPE. An AUTHENTICATED ADMINISTRATOR NAMING A TARGET, which is the
    second of the two shapes the module docstring sets out — not defence by
    absent parameter, and it could not be: enrolment acts on a patient other
    than the caller, so there is a patient identifier and it is in the path.
    What makes that safe is not the identifier's absence but where its
    ORGANISATION comes from. `enrol_patient_login` binds `WHERE patient_id =
    %s AND org_id = %s` with `org_id` from `session.org_id`, so a real
    patient in another tenant reads exactly like an invented one and the
    refusal is byte-identical. The identifier selects a row inside the
    caller's tenant; it never selects a tenant, and it never selects an
    identity.

    THE GATE IS THE DOMAIN METHOD'S AND IT RUNS FIRST. `_require_role(session,
    "Administrator")` is the first statement of `enrol_patient_login`'s body,
    before the patient read and before the uniqueness read. Nothing in this
    handler asks what roles the caller holds. That ordering is what makes the
    403 a function of the caller's own roles alone: a non-Administrator gets
    the identical refusal whether the named patient is real, invented, in
    another tenant, or already enrolled.

    EXACTLY ONE DECORATED CALL. `@auditable` commits after each audit row, so
    a handler that read the patient back, or looked the credential up to
    return its email, would commit the enrolment's audit row and then fail
    with the record already written. The domain method is one `@transactional`
    body under one `@auditable` for that reason and this handler does not
    undo it.

    409, NOT 404 AND NOT 400. `PatientAlreadyEnrolledError` is the domain's
    own refusal and it carries the domain's own message, which explains that
    a second credential for one patient is a PROXY-ACCESS decision rather
    than a re-enrolment. Folding it into the 404 would tell an Administrator
    that a patient they can see does not exist, and folding it into the 403
    would tell them they are not an Administrator. It is raised strictly
    after the gate and after the same-organisation read, so the only
    principal who can ever see it is an Administrator naming a patient in
    their own tenant — it varies with nothing outside it.

    NOTHING IS RETURNED BUT THE IDENTIFIER, and in particular the password is
    not echoed. The credential the caller gets back is the handle the
    revocation route takes.

    THE TARGET IS A CREDENTIAL, NOT A PATIENT. The path segment is a
    `patient_login_id`, which is what the domain method takes and what the
    audit row records, and it is deliberately not a `patient_id`: revocation
    withdraws the thing that mints sessions, and every session that credential
    minted ends with it.

    THIS IS A STAFF ROUTE ON THE STAFF ROUTER, authenticated by the STAFF
    session dependency. It touches patient credentials and no patient
    principal can reach it: a patient session id presented here is refused by
    `_get_session` as the anonymous refusal, like any other non-staff
    credential.

    ISSUANCE IS WIRED AS OF w155, above; between w152 and w155 it was not,
    and the module docstring gives the citation and the asymmetry.

    "REVOCATION INVALIDATES LIVE PATIENT SESSIONS" — MEASURED AT 60c48d9, NOT
    ASSUMED, because the answer decides whether anything had to be built here
    and the wrong answer builds a second mechanism.

    `patient_session_valid` reads ONE `patient_sessions` row by session id and
    checks `terminated_at`, `expires_at` and the idle window. It does NOT join
    `patient_logins` and it does NOT read `disabled`. So patient session
    validation does NOT consult the credential's disabled state, and this is
    the w133 `users.disabled` case rather than the w154 role case: the flag is
    read by nothing on the authenticated path, so writing it invalidates
    nothing by itself, and the termination MUST live in the domain method's
    body. It already does — the `UPDATE patient_sessions SET terminated_at`
    keyed on `patient_login_id`, inside the same `@transactional` body. NO
    SECOND MECHANISM WAS ADDED AT w155, because the first one is the only one
    and adding another could only disagree with it. What w155 added is the
    END-TO-END PROOF the requirement actually asks for: a live patient cookie
    that fetches `/portal/me` before this route is called and is refused by
    the same cookie afterwards, in
    `test_w155_patient_administration.py::TestRevocationInvalidatesLivePatientSessions`.
