──────────────────────────────────
w132c — SESSION TERMINATION, for both principals, through the method and
through the route.

THE STATE BEFORE THIS FILE. `sessions.terminated_at` and
`patient_sessions.terminated_at` were READ on every request and WRITTEN by
almost nothing: the only writer anywhere was `terminate_session`, which ends
SOMEBODY ELSE'S session and is Administrator-gated. `patient_sessions` had no
writer at all. So a session could not be ended by the person holding it, in
either principal, and a browser that had logged in had no way to log out.

THE TWO WRONG VERSIONS THIS FILE WAS BUILT AGAINST, both written and run
before the right one (the counts are in the wave report):

  * TERMINATE BY ID WITHOUT CHECKING OWNERSHIP — a `/auth/logout` that takes
    a `session_id` in the body and ends it, scoped only to the caller's
    organisation. Every "I logged out" row passes. What fails is
    `TestOneSessionAndOnlyOne`: a colleague's session id in the body ends the
    colleague's session.
  * TERMINATE ALL OF A PRINCIPAL'S SESSIONS — the patient version that ends
    every row for the credential rather than the one presented. Every "I
    logged out" row passes here too, and it is worse than the first: nothing
    in a naive suite fails at all, because terminating too much looks exactly
    like terminating enough.

THE POSITIVE TWIN IS THEREFORE THE LOAD-BEARING HALF OF THIS FILE, and it is
a Standing Rule 4 instance in its purest form: "the session is now refused"
is an ABSENCE assertion, and a logout that terminated the entire table
satisfies every one of them. `TestOtherSessionsSurvive` is what the absence
assertions are paired with.

REFUSALS ARE PROVED BY CALLING THE METHOD OR HITTING THE ROUTE (Standing Rule
2a). No test here concludes "the session is dead" from a `SELECT` on
`terminated_at`. The `SELECT`s that do appear assert the VALUE of
`terminated_by` — that it is the EXPECTED id, not merely non-NULL — which is
a different claim and one only a read can make.

        REWRITTEN BY w137, DELIBERATELY AND IN ONE COMMIT WITH THE FIX.

        This row used to assert `org_id IS NULL` and carried a docstring
        explaining the gap: the `@auditable` decorator bound the audit row's
        `org_id`/`user_id` columns from a STAFF `Session` and from nothing
        else, so a patient-principal method could not populate them. Its
        failure message named its own successor — "the decorator now populates
        org_id for a patient-principal method -- good, and this test's
        docstring is out of date" — and w137 is that wave.

        The decorator now reads the organisation from the acting principal for
        `requires_session=False` methods. DECISION 7 IS UNTOUCHED: the refusal
        of a `PatientSession` is keyed on `requires_session=True`, and w130's
        suite plus `test_w137_patient_backend.py::TestDecisionSevenWasNotWidened`
        are the tripwires for it.

        `details` STILL CARRIES BOTH FACTS and that is not redundancy: it is
        how a mismatch between the column and the payload would ever be
        noticed. `user_id` stays NULL because a patient is not a `users` row.

        The org-scoped question — can the organisation's own Auditor actually
        FIND this row, through `read_audit` rather than through a raw SELECT —
        is asked in `test_w137_patient_backend.py`, because a SELECT here sees
