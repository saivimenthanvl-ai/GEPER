"""
dbSNP client.

Looks up rsID and population/frequency annotation for a variant using
NCBI's E-utilities (esearch against the 'snp' database) plus the NCBI
Variation Services REST API for richer per-rsID detail once an rsID is
known.

Allele-aware rsID selection
----------------------------
`_esearch`'s query term is position-based (`{chrom}[CHR] AND
{pos}[POSITION]`), same shape and same limitation as
`database/clinvar_client.py`'s positional ClinVar search: dbSNP UIDs
are frequently multi-allelic *and* a single position can host more
than one distinct rsID. Confirmed live: 17:43094298 (GRCh38) returns
two -- `rs397508848`, a 2bp deletion (`c.1232_1233del`), and
`rs80357024`, the SNV actually being analyzed (`c.1233T>G`, alongside
its A>G/A>T siblings under the same rsID). An earlier version of this
client took `uids[0]` unconditionally, which resolved `rs397508848`
for that position -- the wrong rsID, silently attributed to the
queried variant in report text ("Catalogued in dbSNP as
rs397508848") and (before `database/clinvar_client.py`'s own retrieval
fix) fed straight into a ClinVar rsID search that then couldn't find
the correct ClinVar record either, since it never had the right rsID
to search with.

This mirrors `database/clinvar_client.py::ClinVarClient`'s fix in
spirit -- classify every candidate with `variant_match`, report a
tri-state status, never guess -- but is deliberately its own
`DbSNPMatchStatus` enum rather than importing `ClinVarMatchStatus`
across modules: the two clients query unrelated NCBI resources with
independent lifecycles (`pipeline/stage_schemas.py::StageStatus` and
`pipeline/provenance.py::VersionStatus` are the same kind of
intentionally-separate-but-parallel pair in this codebase, for the
same reason). The dbSNP 'snp' db esummary conveniently returns an
`spdi` field in the *same* `seq:0-based-pos:ref:alt` format ClinVar's
`canonical_spdi` uses (comma-joined when one rsID covers multiple ALT
alleles), so `_variant_match` here is the same position+allele check,
just parsing a flatter field.
