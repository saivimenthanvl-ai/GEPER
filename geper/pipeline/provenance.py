"""
Data-source version pinning and run provenance.

Why this exists: ClinVar, ClinGen, gnomAD, HPO, Orphanet, InterPro, and the
PS3/BS3 functional-evidence sources all change on their own schedules
(ClinVar weekly) -- a report that says "ClinVar reports Pathogenic" with no
record of WHICH ClinVar snapshot cannot be reproduced later. This module is
the mechanism that makes a GEPER report reproducible: it records, for every
external data source consulted in a run, whatever version/release/hash/
timestamp identifier that source actually exposes -- and is honest when one
doesn't exist, rather than fabricating a uniform-looking answer.

Audit result (verified live against each source during development, not
assumed -- see `RunProvenanceCollector`'s own per-source capture call sites
in `pipeline/orchestrator.py` for where each of these was confirmed):

  Real, queryable version/release identifier:
    - gnomAD: the GraphQL `datasetId` ("gnomad_r4"/"gnomad_r2_1") IS the
      release identifier -- known statically per query, not fetched.
    - dbSNP: `last_update_build_id` in the variation-detail response
      (api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/v0/refsnp/{id}) -- a real dbSNP
      build number (verified: 157).
    - InterPro: every live REST response carries an `InterPro-Version`
      header (verified: "109.0"), including on a single-protein query.
    - UniProt: every live REST response carries `X-UniProt-Release` /
      `X-UniProt-Release-Date` / `X-API-Deployment-Date` headers
      (verified: release "2026_02").
    - AlphaFold DB: already captured per-entry as `model_version`
      (`pipeline/alphafold/provider.py`, from the summary API's
      `latestVersion`) -- no change needed here, just surfaced.
    - Orphanet: already captured as `data_version`, parsed from the
      `date` attribute of the downloaded XML's own root `<JDBOR>`
      element (`pipeline/orphanet/utils.py::parse_gene_disorder_xml`)
      -- no change needed here either.
    - Ensembl: `/info/data` returns the current release number
      (verified: `{"releases": [116]}`) -- one lightweight call per
      run, not per-variant (the release cannot change mid-run).
    - ClinGen gene-validity download: the server's `Content-Disposition`
      filename embeds the release date (verified:
      "Clingen-Gene-Disease-Summary-2026-07-31.csv") in addition to
      `Last-Modified`.
    - MANE Select summary download: the release version is embedded in
      the downloaded file's own name on NCBI's directory listing
      (verified live 2026-08-08: "MANE.GRCh38.v1.5.summary.txt.gz" ->
      "MANE 1.5"), parsed at bootstrap time -- see
      `pipeline/mane/bootstrap.py`.
    - BLAST (local mode): `database/blast_client.py::get_blast_tool_versions`
      already captures each local blast+ CLI tool's own `-version`
      output -- no change needed here, just surfaced.
    - AlphaMissense catalogue (GCS-hosted): the download response's
      `ETag` (GCS's own MD5 of the object), `x-goog-hash`, and
      `x-goog-generation` headers are a precise, server-authoritative
      content identifier -- verified live via a HEAD request (no full
      ~9GB download performed; this module only ever inspects headers
      captured by the code path that already downloads this file for
      real use).

  No release version, but a content hash and/or download timestamp is
  obtainable (the cached/bootstrapped file itself, once fetched):
    - ClinGen dosage-sensitivity download: `Last-Modified`/`ETag`
      headers exist but no embedded release date; sha256 of the
      downloaded content is computed and persisted instead.
    - HPO genes_to_phenotype.txt: same -- `Last-Modified`/`ETag`
      headers exist, no in-content version; sha256 persisted.

  Genuinely no version identifier available via the API GEPER uses --
  reported as UNKNOWN with an explanatory note, not silently omitted or
  guessed, per this module's core design principle (see `VersionStatus`):
    - ClinVar (E-utilities esummary): no database-wide release version
      is exposed by this API. Individual records already carry their
      own `last_evaluated` date (`database/clinvar_client.py`), which
      is NOT the same claim as "this is ClinVar release X" -- reported
      honestly as source-level UNKNOWN, with the per-record dates still
      visible in each variant's own ClinVar evidence.
    - ClinGen Evidence Repository (ERepo) / MaveDB (PS3/BS3 functional
      evidence): no source-wide API version; individual records/score-
      sets carry their own `publishedDate`, same treatment as ClinVar
      above.
    - MyVariant.info (GERP++ fallback): the only version-shaped field on
      a record is `_version`, which is MyVariant.info's internal
      Elasticsearch document-revision counter, NOT a dbNSFP/GERP data
      release -- verified live and deliberately NOT used here, since
      presenting it as a data version would be actively misleading.
    - BLAST remote mode (NCBI QBlast): the `nt` database updates
      continuously with no version exposed via the search API.
    - UCSC conservation API (PhyloP/PhastCons): DOES expose a genuine
      per-track `dataTime` field (verified live) -- NOT wired through to
      `ConservationAnnotation` in this pass (that dataclass is shared
      across the bigWig/API/MyVariant sources and threading a new field
      through all three call sites is a larger change than this pass's
      scope) -- disclosed here as a known gap, not silently dropped;
      only the query timestamp is captured for this source today.

Design principle (point 6 of the task this module was built for): "version
unknown" must be structurally distinguishable from "source not consulted".
`RunProvenanceCollector` is pre-seeded with every known source name at
construction time, each starting at `VersionStatus.NOT_CONSULTED` -- a
source stays in that state for the whole run if (and only if) nothing in
the pipeline ever actually queried it (e.g. ClinGen disabled via config).
`VersionStatus.UNKNOWN` is a DIFFERENT, later state a source can only reach
by first being consulted (see the priority ordering in `RunProvenanceCollector
.record`) -- so the two can never collapse into each other the way an absent
dict key collapsed "never ran" and "ran, found nothing" before the schema
work (`pipeline/stage_schemas.py`).

    WHERE this run's answer from a source actually came from -- a
    SEPARATE AXIS from `VersionStatus`, which is only ever about
    version identifiability.

    Deliberately NOT a sixth `VersionStatus` member, for two reasons:

      1. The two facts are independent. A BLAST result replayed from
         the on-disk cache in local mode still has a real, known
         blast+ tool version; a live remote query has none. Every
         combination of (version identifiability x retrieval mode) is
         reachable, so folding one into the other would force
         recording either fact to destroy the other -- the same
         collapse `VersionStatus`'s own docstring exists to prevent.
      2. `VersionStatus` is TOTALLY ORDERED, and that ordering is
         load-bearing: `RunProvenanceCollector.record` uses it to stop
         a later degraded query downgrading an already-captured real
         version. "Replayed from cache" is not more or less
         informative than "version known" -- there is no honest place
         to put it in that ordering. Retrieval mode therefore MERGES
         (see `RunProvenanceCollector.note_retrieval`) rather than
         ranking.

    Why it matters clinically: a cache replay returns bytes a previous
    run obtained, and this run cannot verify they are still current.
    ClinVar reclassifies weekly; NCBI's `nt` changes continuously. A
    report that cannot distinguish "we asked the source and it said
    this" from "we reused what it said some unrecorded time ago" is
    making a stronger claim than it can support.
