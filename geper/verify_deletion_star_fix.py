# *** THE VERDICT BELOW IS UNDATED. ***
#
# WHAT THIS IS, in its own words: Verification harness for the deletion/spanning-allele '*' fix
#
# NOTHING RE-RUNS THIS FILE. Measured 2026-09-11 across the 17 files matching
# geper/verify_*.py, geper/benchmark_*.py and dry_run_harness.py: ZERO are
# referenced in .github/workflows, and pytest does not collect any of them,
# because they are not named test_*. So whatever this script printed, it
# printed on the day somebody ran it by hand -- AND WHICH DAY THAT WAS IS
# RECORDED NOWHERE. `git log` on this file gives the date it was EDITED,
# which is a different fact and must not be quoted as if it were this one.
#
# WHY THE NOTE RATHER THAN A FIX: the file is not broken. Its stubs are
# honest -- it fakes everything EXCEPT the thing it verifies, and it
# propagates its exit code -- and all 59 stub targets across these harnesses
# were still defined when this was written, so they can all still be applied.
# The risk is CITATION: 'verify' is in the filename, which invites someone to
# quote this file's green as evidence. That is the `docker history` shape --
# something that reads as a record and is not one.
#
# IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO CITE THIS FILE: run it, and say when you ran it.

Verification harness for the deletion/spanning-allele '*' fix.

BUG BEING VERIFIED
-------------------
Some VCF records use ALT='*' (VCF spec: "the allele is missing due to
an overlapping/spanning deletion called on a different sample or
haplotype at this position") or a symbolic structural ALT like
'<DEL>', '<INS>', '<DUP>'. Neither is a literal base sequence.

Before this fix, VCFParser passed these straight through as ordinary
Variant records. SequenceContextGenerator.build_context then spliced
the literal ALT text ('*' or '<DEL>') into the reference window to
build `alt_sequence`, and RNAGenerator._transcribe (called by both the
RNA and protein pipeline stages) rejected the resulting string with
"Cannot transcribe DNA sequence containing invalid base(s)" -- the
exact failure this session reported for RNA-FM and ESM-2.

WHY A MOCK ENSEMBL LAYER
--------------------------
This sandbox's outbound network doesn't reach the Ensembl REST API
(only package registries are allowlisted). Only
`SequenceContextGenerator._fetch_region` (the one method that calls
`requests.get`) is replaced with a fixed reference window; every other
line of real GEPER code (VCFParser, SequenceContextGenerator's
splicing logic, RNAGenerator, GeperPipeline) runs unmodified.

THE FIX
--------
VCFParser now recognizes ALT='*' and symbolic '<...>' alleles at parse
time -- before any sequence context is ever built -- logs why each
record was skipped, tallies the reasons in `parser.skip_counts`, and
never yields a Variant for them. This is the same place/pattern
already used to skip a record with a missing REF/ALT allele.
