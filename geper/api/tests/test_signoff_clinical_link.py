───────────────────────────────────────

w117 commit 6: review/signoff.py's LINKED path, against a REAL PostgreSQL
(api/tests/conftest.py::clinical_conn -- disposable databases only) and the
REAL DataAccess, not a stand-in for it. The clinical enforcement these tests
lean on -- role checks, the state machine, the claim preconditions -- is the
production code's, so a test here cannot pass by agreeing with a fake.

THE DEFECT. api/submission_worker.py writes `clinical_link.json` into the
output directory of every run it records as a clinical interpretation, and
nothing read it. A clinician could `approve()` such a run, get a signed PDF
with their name on every page, and leave the CLINICAL REPORT -- what an
inspector, a LIMS and the amendment machinery all read -- still saying
'draft', with no reviewer claim, no approver_id, no approved_at and no
content_hash. Two records of one act, disagreeing, the authoritative one
wrong.

STILL ONE-PERSON SIGN-OFF (human ruling, 2026-09-13). Nothing here requires a
second clinician. The change is that the clinical record now SAYS one person
signed, through the claim kind that means exactly that ('sole_signatory',
commit 5) rather than 'accept', which means an independent concurrence by a
second clinician and would be a false statement here.

THE TWO CONTROLS, both of which must stay green:
  - TestUnlinkedRunIsUnchanged: a run with no clinical_link.json signs off
    and overrides exactly as it did before, with no credentials, no DSN and
    no database.
  - TestTheSignedPdfNeverLeadsTheClinicalRecord: every clinical refusal
    (missing credentials, missing reason, wrong password, a signatory without
    the Approver role) leaves the directory byte-for-byte as it was. That is
    the write-order rule as a test rather than as a comment.

    clinical/data_access.py has no unapprove/retract method;
    reports.approver_id/approved_at/content_hash are write-once; and
    enforce_content_immutability() in clinical/schema.sql REFUSES to move an
