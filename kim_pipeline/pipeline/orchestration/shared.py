pipeline/orchestration/shared.py

Shared orchestration helpers used by BOTH entry points:

  * PipelineRunner.run() (the `analyze` FASTQ→Report workflow, in
    pipeline/orchestration/runner.py)
  * cmd_vcf() (the `vcf` annotate-and-classify workflow, in main.py)

This module exists so the ACMG + ClinVar + gnomAD + AI evidence-scoring
logic is implemented exactly once. It was previously inlined only inside
PipelineRunner.run(), which meant `python main.py vcf` silently skipped
ClinVar, gnomAD, PGx-relevant constraint/hotspot lookups, and the AI engine
entirely. Extracting it here lets both code paths share the identical,
already-tested logic — no behavior change for `analyze`, full wiring for
`vcf`.

NOTE: this is a refactor (move), not a rewrite. The per-variant evidence
construction and ACMG classification logic below is unchanged from the
original inline implementation in runner.py.
