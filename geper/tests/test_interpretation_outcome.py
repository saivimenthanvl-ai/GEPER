─────────────────────────────────────

Human ruling (2026-09-09/10): the INTERPRETATION-OUTCOME state, a
per-variant judgement carried ALONGSIDE the ACMG classification, never
derived from the per-source retrieval states already in the engine
(`pipeline/stage_schemas.py::StageStatus`). Four values: interpreted,
insufficient_evidence, conflicting_evidence, review_required.

ROUND 2 (2026-09-09/10, this file's second red/green cycle): the
review_required trigger set proposed in round 1 was RULED APPROVED AS
PROPOSED -- exactly two triggers, nothing added, nothing re-opened:
  (1) the evidence pattern that would otherwise be conflicting_evidence
      (comparable-weight pathogenic/benign points).
  (2) acmg_classification in {"Pathogenic", "Likely Pathogenic"}.

THIS IS THE PART OF THE RED THAT CHANGED AN EXISTING TEST, NOT ONLY
ADDED NEW ONES: `test_review_required_is_never_returned_by_this_function`
below used to assert review_required was unreachable -- that stopped
being true the moment the trigger set was approved, so leaving it
unchanged would make this file assert a now-false claim. It is REPLACED
(see `TestReviewRequiredTriggers` below) with tests that pin WHICH
inputs produce review_required and which do NOT, rather than deleted --
deleting it would have quietly dropped the negative-space coverage
(inputs that must still NOT produce it) along with the outdated
positive claim.

THE COLLISION DECISION (mine, stated explicitly, not settled by the
ruling): a variant CAN satisfy both triggers at once -- e.g.
pathogenic_points=12, benign_points=6 is comparable-weight (ratio 0.5)
AND nets to 6, which is Likely Pathogenic. Only one string can be
`interpretation_outcome`, so on EITHER trigger firing, the returned
value is `review_required` (an escalation takes priority over naming
which evidence pattern produced it -- see
`pipeline/interpretation_outcome.py`'s own docstring for the full
argument). WHAT IS LOST: a reader who sees only `review_required` does
not know, from that field alone, whether it fired because of a genuine
evidence disagreement, a P/LP call, or both. THE ANSWER TO "if both
need to be visible, say so": `determine_review_required_reasons()`
(new function, same module) computes the SAME two conditions
independently and returns the list of which one(s) actually fired,
ALWAYS present (an empty list when review_required did not fire,
mirroring `pipeline/provenance.py::get_stale_fallbacks`'s own
"checked, nothing" vs "never checked" discipline) -- see
`TestDetermineReviewRequiredReasons` below.

ROUND 3 (2026-09-10, RULED (b)): `InterpretationOutcome.CONFLICTING_EVIDENCE`
is REMOVED from the public enum entirely -- not merely unreachable as a
return value (that was round 2's state, described above and no longer
current). Ruling (c) -- change the escalation trigger to restore a
directly-reachable conflicting_evidence -- was explicitly REJECTED: the
escalation exists so a genuine evidence conflict reaches a human
reviewer, and weakening it to tidy an enum would trade a safety
behaviour for a naming problem. So nothing about WHICH inputs produce
`review_required` may change here, only whether the now-permanently-
unreachable member is still importable. The internal three-way
distinction (`_base_outcome`'s own return type, now `_BaseOutcome`, a
private enum never exported) is unchanged -- see
`pipeline/interpretation_outcome.py`'s own docstring. The reason string
`"conflicting_evidence"` in `determine_review_required_reasons()`'s
returned list is a DIFFERENT, still-valid, still-reachable value --
a reason code, not an outcome state, and the ruling did not touch it;
see `TestDetermineReviewRequiredReasons` below, unchanged by round 3.
`test_conflicting_evidence_enum_member_is_gone_but_escalation_still_fires`
below replaces `test_conflicting_evidence_is_now_unreachable_via_the_public_function`
(round 2's test, whose own premise -- "the member still exists" -- round
3 made false) and pins the ACTUAL load-bearing claim: the same inputs
that used to reach `CONFLICTING_EVIDENCE` still escalate to
`REVIEW_REQUIRED`, identically, whether or not the member exists to be
returned instead.

Declared BEFORE running, against master da35c979 (this branch's own
prior interpretation-outcome-state work, already merged, before THIS
round's production changes): EXPECTED RESULT was FAILURE --
`determine_interpretation_outcome()` does not yet accept a
`classification` keyword argument, and `determine_review_required_reasons`
does not exist yet, so every test that passes `classification=` or
imports `determine_review_required_reasons` must fail with a
`TypeError` or `ImportError` respectively. Confirmed failing (see the
commit history: the test-only commit on this branch precedes the
production-code commit) before any production code changed.

THE TEST THIS FILE EXISTS TO WRITE, ROUND 1 (dispatch's own words,
still true and still here, unchanged by round 2): "write the test that
would catch the defect this task exists to prevent: a query that FAILS
must not produce insufficient_evidence. Prove it by making a source
fail on purpose." That is
`TestAcmgRuleEngineNeverRelabelsAFailureAsInsufficiency::
test_a_source_failing_on_purpose_does_not_produce_insufficient_evidence`
below -- a real `ACMGRuleEngine().evaluate()` call, one evidence source
deliberately given a genuine `error` key (not a `found: False`, not a
skip), every other source and the gene resolution status otherwise
clean-empty, and the assertion is that `interpretation_outcome` is
`"interpreted"`, never `"insufficient_evidence"`.
