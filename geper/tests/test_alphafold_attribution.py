"""
Regression coverage for commit 3927c82 (AlphaFold DB CC-BY-4.0 attribution
fix). AlphaFold DB is integrated into GEPER (confidence bands, model
version, structural context) but never contributes ACMG criterion
evidence, so it was previously absent from `evidence_sources` and
therefore never reached `_REFERENCES`'s conditional gate -- present in
the pipeline, never cited in a shipped report. The fix (following the
existing Orphanet precedent) makes the citation unconditional.

Real Markdown and PDF output is generated (ReportLab + pypdf, same
pattern `tests/test_confidence_caption.py` already established) and
inspected for the citation text, rather than asserting on `_references()`
alone -- the earlier Orphanet/HPO citation bug (see `report/summary.py`'s
own comment near its references-rendering call site) was specifically a
case where the builder computed the right list but a renderer never
consumed it, so testing only the builder would not have caught that
class of defect.
