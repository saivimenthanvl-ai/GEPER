# *** THE VERDICT BELOW IS UNDATED. ***
#
# WHAT THIS IS, in its own words: Verification harness for the Ensembl fetch caching + batch-prefetch
#
# NOTHING RE-RUNS THIS FILE. Measured 2026-09-11 across the 17 files matching
# geper/verify_*.py, geper/benchmark_*.py and dry_run_harness.py: ZERO are
# referenced in .github/workflows, and pytest does not collect any of them,
# because they are not named test_*. So whatever this script printed, it
# printed on the day somebody ran it by hand -- AND WHICH DAY THAT WAS IS
# RECORDED NOWHERE. `git log` on this file gives the date it was EDITED,
# which is a different fact and must not be quoted as if it were this one.
#
# WHY THE NOTE RATHER THAN A FIX: the file is not broken. Its stubs are
# honest -- it fakes everything EXCEPT the thing it verifies, and it
# propagates its exit code -- and all 59 stub targets across these harnesses
# were still defined when this was written, so they can all still be applied.
# The risk is CITATION: 'verify' is in the filename, which invites someone to
# quote this file's green as evidence. That is the `docker history` shape --
# something that reads as a record and is not one.
#
# IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO CITE THIS FILE: run it, and say when you ran it.

"""
Verification harness for the Ensembl fetch caching + batch-prefetch
performance optimization.

WHAT'S BEING VERIFIED
-----------------------
1. Caching: two variants that need the identical (chrom, start, end)
   window (e.g. a multi-allelic site normalized into two Variant
   records) trigger exactly ONE network fetch, not two -- and both
   variants still get the exact same, correct sequence.
2. Batching: prefetch_regions() issues one POST per batch instead of
   one GET per variant, and the sequences it caches are IDENTICAL to
   what the unbatched per-variant GET path would have produced for the
   same regions (this is the correctness property that matters most:
   the optimization must be invisible to prediction output).
3. Fail-safe fallback: if the batch POST fails, or returns a malformed/
   wrong-length entry, prefetch_regions must not raise, and
   build_context must still succeed afterwards (falling back to its
   normal per-variant GET), producing the exact same sequence it
   always would have.

WHY A MOCK ENSEMBL LAYER
--------------------------
This sandbox's outbound network doesn't reach Ensembl (only package
registries are allowlisted). Only `requests.Session.get` /
`requests.Session.post` are replaced with a small fake genome server;
every other line of real GEPER code (SequenceContextGenerator's window
math, its cache, its batching/fallback logic) runs unmodified.
