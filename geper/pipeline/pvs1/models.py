"""
Data model for the PVS1 (null variant) evidence rule.

Kept deliberately separate from `pipeline/vcf_parser.py::Variant` and
from the per-variant evidence shapes already in this codebase, for the
same reason `pipeline/clingen/models.py` is separate: PVS1 is the one
ACMG/AMP criterion whose answer depends on *transcript structure* --
which exon the variant lands in, how much coding sequence lies 3' of
it, and where the last exon-exon junction is -- and none of GEPER's
existing evidence dicts carry that. `TranscriptContext` below is that
missing input, modelled once here and consumed by
`pipeline/pvs1/decision_tree.py`.

Everything in this module is pure: plain dataclasses, arithmetic, and
`to_dict()`. No network, no IO, no CONFIG-dependent behaviour -- so the
decision tree built on top of it is fully unit-testable against frozen
transcript structures (see `tests/fixtures/pvs1_transcripts.json`,
which holds real Ensembl MANE Select structures).

Coordinate conventions used throughout:
  - All genomic coordinates are 1-based, inclusive, and always stored
    with `start <= end` regardless of strand (Ensembl's convention).
  - "Transcript order" means 5'->3' *along the transcript*: ascending
    genomic coordinate on the + strand, descending on the - strand.
  - CDS coordinates are 1-based from the A of the initiator ATG, i.e.
    the `c.` numbering of HGVS for positions inside the CDS. The
    mapping implemented here was validated against five real ClinVar
    HGVS records on both strands (see `tests/test_pvs1.py`).

        NMD prediction for the frameshifted transcript that results from
        skipping one coding exon (the canonical-splice-site branch of the
        SVI tree).

        Skipping an exon changes the exon-exon junction structure, so NMD
        must be judged against the *post-skip* transcript, not the
        reference one -- evaluating it against the reference junctions is
        the single most common way to get a terminal-exon splice variant
        wrong (it makes the variant look NMD-competent when the new stop
        codon actually lands in the final exon).

        The exact position of the new stop codon is not computable
        without translating the spliced sequence, so this returns the
        earliest position it can occupy -- the junction where the frame
        shifts -- together with the margin between that lower bound and
        the NMD cutoff. A large margin means the NMD call is robust (a
        random frameshift meets a stop codon after ~20 codons on
        average); a small one is reported as uncertain by the caller.

        Returns None if the exon has no coding sequence or the post-skip
        transcript has fewer than two coding exons.
