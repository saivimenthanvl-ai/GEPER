"""
PS1 and PM5 evaluation logic.

ACMG/AMP 2015 (Richards et al., Genet Med 17:405) defines both as a
comparison against a previously established pathogenic variant at the
same codon:

  PS1 (Strong): "Same amino acid change as a previously established
  pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change" -- e.g. a known
  pathogenic Arg175His and a novel nucleotide change that also
  produces Arg175His.

  PM5 (Moderate): "Novel missense change at an amino acid residue
  where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has
  been seen before" -- e.g. a known pathogenic Arg175His and a novel
  Arg175Cys at the same residue.

Both share one evidence-gathering step (every ClinVar record with a
parseable missense protein change at the query variant's codon --
see `pipeline/ps1_pm5/lookup.py`) and diverge only at the amino-acid
comparison: PS1 wants `alt_aa` to match; PM5 wants it to differ.
`_qualifying_anchors` implements the comparison both rules share
(confidence filtering, self-exclusion); `evaluate_ps1`/`evaluate_pm5`
each call it with the opposite `same_amino_acid` flag, then
`_finalize` applies the splice-proximity caveat and builds the
`PS1PM5Evaluation` both return.

This module is pure: no network, no CONFIG-dependent behaviour beyond
what is passed in via `PS1PM5Thresholds`, so it is unit-testable
against frozen ClinVar match lists exactly like
`pipeline/pvs1/decision_tree.py`.
