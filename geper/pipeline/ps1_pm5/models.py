"""
Data model for the PS1 and PM5 (established-pathogenic-position)
evidence rules.

Both criteria answer variations on one question -- "has ClinVar
already established a pathogenic missense change at this codon, and
how does it relate to the amino acid change this variant makes?" -- so
they share one evidence-gathering step (`ClinVarCodonMatch`, one
qualifying ClinVar record found at the query variant's codon) and
split only at the final comparison: PS1 wants an anchor with the
*same* resulting amino acid as the query (different nucleotide
change); PM5 wants a *different* resulting amino acid at the same
codon. See `pipeline/ps1_pm5/decision.py` for that comparison.

Kept as a separate package from `pipeline/pvs1/`, mirroring why that
package is itself separate from `acmg_rules.py`: this evidence needs a
different external input (a codon-neighborhood ClinVar search) that no
other rule needs, and the confidence-tier / protein-change-parsing
logic it requires is substantial enough to deserve its own module
rather than being folded into `pipeline/acmg_rules.py` directly.
