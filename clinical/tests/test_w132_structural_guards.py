w132 — the guards that keep the shape after the wave is forgotten. Tests
only; no production code depends on this file.

Each row here catches a change that is ONE LINE, looks like an improvement,
and that no behavioural test in this repository would fail on:

  * a second route setting its own cookie, with its own flags;
  * a CORS middleware added "so the portal can call the API";
  * a route mounted that nobody counted (Standing Rule 9 — and see
    `TestTheRouteCensus` for why `app.routes` is not the naive answer it
    looks like on this version of FastAPI);
  * `ConfigurationError` dropped from the login handler's except clause,
    which reopens the MFA status oracle the moment somebody also tidies away
    the broad backstop underneath it.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# THE ANCHOR (w132c) — the cannot-fail shape, applied to these guards
# themselves.
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# EVERY GUARD IN THIS FILE READS SOURCE BY PATH, and a path is a claim about
# where something is. When the claim is wrong the guard does not fail — it
# reads an empty directory, finds zero offenders, and reports green. That is
# the Phase 5d cannot-fail shape exactly: a test satisfied by the broken state
# as readily as by the working one, except that here the "broken state" is the
# test's own footing.
#
# THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL ON THIS REPOSITORY. Four concrete ways the footing
# moves, none of which any assertion below would otherwise notice:
#
#   * THE TWO CI JOBS RUN FROM DIFFERENT WORKING DIRECTORIES — the clinical
#     job from `clinical/`, the geper job from `geper/`. A path built by
#     parent traversal from `__file__` is stable under that; a path built from
#     the process's cwd is not, and the two are one careless edit apart.
#   * A MOVED TEST FILE. `parent.parent` is a distance, not a destination.
#     Move this file one directory deeper and `CLINICAL` becomes `clinical/`
#     — no, it becomes `clinical/tests/`, whose `rglob("*.py")` finds only
#     tests and whose `auth_endpoints.py` does not exist.
#   * A RENAMED PACKAGE. `TREE.rglob` over a tree with no `clinical/` in it
#     returns files, so a count-based sanity check still passes; what
#     disappears is the specific module every guard is about.
#   * AN INSTALLED SECOND COPY. The guards read a file from disk while the
#     application under test imports `clinical.auth_endpoints` from
#     site-packages. Both succeed, and they are about different code.
#
# So: every path this file uses goes through `_anchor()`, which names LANDMARK
# FILES rather than counting anything, and the anchor has its own negative
# twin (`TestTheAnchorItself`) proving it fails on an empty tree. A guard that
# cannot find its target now FAILS LOUDLY instead of passing quietly.

# Files that must exist for ANY guard in this file to mean anything. Landmarks,
# not a census: the list is short, specific, and spans both packages, so it
# cannot be satisfied by an arbitrary Python tree.
