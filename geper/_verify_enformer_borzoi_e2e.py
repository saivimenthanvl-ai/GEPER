# *** THE VERDICT BELOW IS UNDATED. ***
#
# WHAT THIS IS, in its own words: Standalone, human-readable evidence script (not a unit test) proving,
#
# NOTHING RE-RUNS THIS FILE. Measured 2026-09-11 across the 17 files matching
# geper/verify_*.py, geper/benchmark_*.py and dry_run_harness.py: ZERO are
# referenced in .github/workflows, and pytest does not collect any of them,
# because they are not named test_*. So whatever this script printed, it
# printed on the day somebody ran it by hand -- AND WHICH DAY THAT WAS IS
# RECORDED NOWHERE. `git log` on this file gives the date it was EDITED,
# which is a different fact and must not be quoted as if it were this one.
#
# WHY THE NOTE RATHER THAN A FIX: the file is not broken. Its stubs are
# honest -- it fakes everything EXCEPT the thing it verifies, and it
# propagates its exit code -- and all 59 stub targets across these harnesses
# were still defined when this was written, so they can all still be applied.
# The risk is CITATION: 'verify' is in the filename, which invites someone to
# quote this file's green as evidence. That is the `docker history` shape --
# something that reads as a record and is not one.
#
# IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO CITE THIS FILE: run it, and say when you ran it.

"""
Standalone, human-readable evidence script (not a unit test) proving,
with real code execution, each of the 5 claims requested:

  1. Enformer is actually instantiated and inference is executed.
  2. Borzoi is actually instantiated and inference is executed.
  3. Their prediction objects are consumed by the AI evidence aggregator
     (EnsembleManager).
  4. Their outputs influence ACMG PP3/BP4.
  5. The clinical report contains actual Enformer/Borzoi prediction
     sections, not only status entries.

Network access to huggingface.co is unavailable in this sandbox
(confirmed by the existing test suite's own docstrings, e.g.
tests/test_new_plugins_integration.py), so `from_pretrained` is
mocked at exactly the same boundary the existing, passing test suite
already uses -- everything else (plugin instantiation, `_load_impl`,
`_infer_impl`, `ModelManager`, `EnsembleManager`, `ACMGRuleEngine`,
`build_variant_result`, `ReportGenerator`) is the real, unmodified
production code path.
