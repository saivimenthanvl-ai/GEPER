w162 — THE ORDERING CLINICIAN'S SURFACE. Patient registration and consent,
and nothing else.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, STATED AS THE MEASUREMENT AND NOT AS A STORY.
Measured at `w126m-migrations` tip `44d624b` by an `ast.Call` census over
every non-test module in the repository — never grep, which credits a
docstring as a caller:

    create_patient        0 production call sites
    record_consent        0 production call sites
    withdraw_consent      0 production call sites

and the only production writer of a `patients` row is `create_patient`
itself (`INSERT INTO patients`, data_access.py:2370), while the only
production writer of a `consents` row is `record_consent` (the INSERT and
the supersession UPDATE) and `withdraw_consent` (the withdrawal UPDATE).
There is no second path to either table. So the three verbs were the whole
mechanism and NOT ONE of them was reachable over HTTP, and — until the
commit this module arrives with — not one of them enforced a role either.

THE RULING THIS WAVE IMPLEMENTS (human, 2026-09-19):

    PATIENT REGISTRATION + CONSENT — the ORDERER/CLINICIAN owns both.
    Do NOT make Administrator registration mandatory. Do NOT make Lab
    Technician a patient identity creator.

"ORDERER" IS THE TOKEN, AND IT IS READ OFF THE TREE RATHER THAN CHOSEN.
`data_access.ROLES` is the vocabulary the schema's CHECK constraint on
`role_assignments.role` enumerates: Orderer, Lab technician, Interpreter,
Approver, Administrator, Auditor, System. Exactly one of those names a
clinician, and `create_order`'s own docstring already says which and why —
"Ordering a test is the clinical decision the Orderer role names". The
ruling's "ordering clinician" and the vocabulary's "Orderer" are the same
principal, and registration and consent are now gated on it, INSIDE the
three domain methods, as each one's first executable statement.

CLINICIAN-ONLY, AND ADMINISTRATOR IS NOT ADDED ALONGSIDE. The ruling
forbids MANDATORY Administrator registration; it does not say whether an
Administrator may ALSO register. The tree does not answer it either, and it
answers the adjacent question in the narrow direction: `create_order`'s
docstring records that "an Administrator is not implicitly an Orderer,
because the ruling gives Administrator organisation/staff administration
and a role that silently subsumes the others is the RBAC redesign the same
ruling forbids". So this wave implements the NARROWER reading — Orderer
alone — and the widening is carded rather than assumed. Widening a gate
later is a one-line change with a test; narrowing one after deployment is
a capability withdrawal.

WHY A THIRD ROUTER AND NOT `/admin` OR `/lab`.
The house's own rule, stated in both existing surfaces, is that the prefix
NAMES THE SURFACE and is not an authorisation statement (`/admin/audit` is
Auditor-gated, `/admin/reports/{id}/retraction` is Approver-gated). Read
that way, neither existing prefix fits:

  * `/admin` names the ADMINISTRATIVE surface. Filing clinician-owned
    registration under it would encode in the URL — in every route census,
    every access log and every reverse-proxy rule — precisely the reading
    the ruling rejects: that registering a patient is an administrative act.
  * `/lab` names the LABORATORY BENCH, and its module docstring says so:
    the prefix exists "so that every bench operation is visibly
    laboratory-operational". Registration and consent are not bench
    operations, and the ruling names Lab Technician as the role that must
    NOT create a patient identity.

`/clinic` names the third surface this service has: the ordering
clinician's. It is also where the ORDER stage belongs when the `tests`
catalogue unblocks it — `create_order`, `place_order` and `cancel_order`
are Orderer-gated, complete, and have zero production callers, and they are
deliberately NOT here (see WHAT IS NOT HERE, below).

NO SECOND ANYTHING. `_get_session` and `_get_data_access` are IMPORTED from
`clinical/endpoints.py`; `_forbidden`, `_not_found` and `_target` and their
two body constants are IMPORTED from `clinical/admin_endpoints.py`. This
module defines no dependency, no refusal string, no SQL and no role check.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE SECURITY MODEL, IN THE ORDER A REQUEST MEETS IT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. AUTHENTICATION — `Depends(_get_session)`, the same staff dependency the
   administrative, exception and laboratory routes use. Every failure —
   absent, malformed, unknown, expired, terminated, or a PATIENT session id
   presented to a staff route — is `_anonymous_refusal()`: 401,
   `GENERIC_AUTH_ERROR`, byte for byte.

2. ORGANISATION CONTEXT — DERIVED, NEVER SUPPLIED. `Session.org_id` comes
   out of the `sessions` row. No route here accepts an organisation in a
   path segment, a query parameter or a body field, and every request model
   sets `extra="forbid"`, so a body that tries to carry one is REFUSED
   rather than silently ignored. `create_patient` binds `org_id =
   session.org_id` in its INSERT; `record_consent` and `withdraw_consent`
   bind `AND org_id = %s` from the session on every read and every write.

3. ROLE AUTHORISATION — `_require_role(session, "Orderer")`, INSIDE the
   domain method, as its FIRST EXECUTABLE STATEMENT. Not here. Because the
   gate precedes every target read AND every vocabulary check, a 403 from
   this surface is a function of the CALLER'S ROLES ALONE: it carries no
   information about whether the named patient or consent exists, in this
   organisation or any other, and none about whether the body was
   well-formed.

4. AUDIT ATTRIBUTION — `@auditable` on the domain method, untouched. The
   actor is `session.user_id`, the organisation is `session.org_id`, and
   `consents.recorded_by` / `consents.withdrawn_by` take the same value
   from the same place. Nothing in this file writes an audit row, and
   nothing in this file lets a caller name an actor.

   AND NO HANDLER COMPOSES TWO DECORATED METHODS. `@auditable` COMMITS
   after each audit row, so "register the patient, then record the consent"
   as one handler would commit `patient_created` and leave a patient with
   no consent when the second half failed. Each handler calls EXACTLY ONE
   decorated domain method — which is also why the withdrawal route answers
   204 and returns no consent body.

5. ERROR MODEL — THE SAME REFUSALS AS THE OTHER TWO STAFF SURFACES, and
   they are IMPORTED rather than re-declared:

       401 + GENERIC_AUTH_ERROR   not authenticated, in any of its ways
       403 + ADMIN_FORBIDDEN      authenticated, lacks Orderer
       404 + ADMIN_NOT_FOUND      no such patient/consent IN THIS ORGANISATION
       400 + the domain's message a vocabulary or format refusal, AFTER the gate

   NO REQUEST MODEL CONSTRAINS A VALUE, and that is load-bearing rather
   than laziness. Pydantic runs BEFORE the handler and therefore before the
   role gate. A `Literal["M","F","O","U"]` on `sex`, or a `datetime.date`
   on `dob`, would be a 422 answered to a caller holding no Orderer role,
   so the refusal would vary with the CONTENT of the body at a point where
   the caller's authorisation had not been evaluated. Every field here is
   `str`, and BOTH vocabularies — the four sex codes and the ISO-8601 date
   format — are checked by `create_patient`, after the gate.

   THE DATE IS THE ONE THAT HAD TO MOVE. `create_patient` took
   `dob: datetime.date` and could not be handed a string, so the parse
   would have had to happen in this handler, before the gate, exactly like
   the malformed-identifier defect `_target` was rewritten to remove. It
   could not take `_target`'s fix either: substituting a fresh random value
   is right for an IDENTIFIER, which selects nothing when it is wrong, and
   catastrophic for a DATE OF BIRTH, which would be silently recorded. So
   `create_patient` now ACCEPTS EITHER a `date` or an ISO-8601 string and
   parses the string itself, after its own role gate, raising `ValueError`
   the way the `sex` check already does. The vocabulary moved to where the
   house puts vocabularies; nothing about the existing `date` callers
   changed.

   THE 400 IS NOT AN IDENTIFIER CHANNEL. Every `ValueError` these methods
   raise is raised strictly AFTER the role gate, and both messages name
   only a closed public vocabulary or the caller's own submitted value —
   never another tenant, another row, or an identifier the caller did not
   supply.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE SHAPE OF EACH ROUTE, AND WHY IT IS SAFE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The house has two shapes and every route must be classified as one:

  * DEFENCE BY ABSENT PARAMETER — the portal's `list_my_report_trend(self,
    patient_session)` takes no patient identifier at all, so the wrong
    version is unwritable. That is the right shape when the caller IS the
    subject.
  * AN AUTHENTICATED STAFF PRINCIPAL NAMING A TARGET — legitimate because
    the caller is authenticated, the target is resolved INSIDE the caller's
    own organisation, and the organisation comes from the session.

    POST /clinic/patients
        NEITHER SHAPE'S TARGET PROBLEM ARISES: there is no target. The
        patient does not exist yet, the identifier is MINTED by
        `create_patient` (`uuid.uuid4()`), and the organisation is
        `session.org_id`. Nothing in the request can name a patient or an
        organisation. This is the strongest form of the first shape.

    POST /clinic/patients/{patient_id}/consents
    POST /clinic/consents/{consent_id}/withdrawal
        THE SECOND SHAPE. Both act on a row other than the caller, so there
        is an identifier and it is in the PATH. What makes that safe is not
        the identifier's absence but where its ORGANISATION comes from:
        both domain methods bind `AND org_id = %s` from `session.org_id`,
        so a real patient or a real consent in ANOTHER tenant reads exactly
        like an invented one and the refusal is byte-identical. The
        identifier selects a row inside the caller's tenant; it never
        selects a tenant.

REGISTRATION AND CONSENT ARE TWO VERBS, NOT ONE, AND THE TREE DECIDED THAT
BEFORE THIS WAVE. `consents.patient_id` is a foreign key, so the patient
must exist first; `create_order` takes an ALREADY-RECORDED `consent_id`
and re-reads it, so consent is a standing record rather than a step of
registration; and the two acts have two audit actions (`patient_created`,
`consent_recorded`) against two resource types. The ruling requires
"transaction atomicity" and does not require them to be ONE act, so the
existing shape is kept and each verb is INDIVIDUALLY atomic: one
`@transactional` body under one `@auditable`, with no partial state
reachable. A combined verb would have to be a new domain method composing
two decorated ones — which is the `@auditable` composition hazard in its
textbook form — and nobody asked for it.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT THIS SURFACE DOES NOT CLAIM
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE FIRST-ADMINISTRATOR DEADLOCK IS UNCHANGED BY THIS WAVE.
`provision_organisation` still has ZERO production call sites outside
`data_access.py`, and `assign_role` still requires an existing
Administrator. So an Orderer session is exactly as reachable as an
operator invoking `provision_organisation` directly, and these three
routes are IMPLEMENTED + UNREACHABLE-BY-A-FRESH-DEPLOYMENT in the same
sense every administrative and laboratory route already is. What has
changed, and it is the whole point of the wave, is that they are no longer
unreachable BY DESIGN: given a roled session, a clinician can now register
a patient and record consent over HTTP, which was not true at `44d624b`.

WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY — each is a card, not an oversight.

* THE ORDER STAGE (`create_order`, `place_order`, `cancel_order`). All
  three are Orderer-gated and complete; all three have zero production
  callers; and all three would belong on THIS prefix. They are not wired
  because `create_order` requires a `test_id` foreign key into `tests`, a
  table for which NO `DataAccess` method of any kind exists — so no
  production path can create the subject of the route. Who may define a
  test panel is a product decision nobody has made. Carded, unchanged from
  w157.

* A READ SURFACE. `get_patient` and `get_consent` exist, are session-bound
  and are `auditable=False` reads. This wave adds WRITE reachability for
  the three verbs the ruling names and does not invent a patient-search or
  patient-list route: who may enumerate patients, and on what predicate, is
  a question the ruling did not answer.

* PATIENT AMENDMENT OR DELETION. No domain method exists for either.

    THERE IS NO `org_id` FIELD, NO `patient_id` FIELD AND NO `created_by`
    FIELD, and all three absences are the design. The organisation is
    `Session.org_id`; the identifier is MINTED by `create_patient`; and the
    registering actor is `session.user_id`, recorded by `@auditable`. A
    caller-supplied identifier would let a request name a row, and a
    caller-supplied actor would be a claim — the rule this repository
    already settled (`ResolutionRequest` in `clinical/endpoints.py`) is that
    such a field is REMOVED rather than validated.

    `dob` IS `str` AND NOT `datetime.date`, AND THAT IS THE LOAD-BEARING
    ONE. A `datetime.date` annotation makes Pydantic refuse `"not-a-date"`
