tests/test_undetermined_aa_guard.py
────────────────────────────────────
Guard: an undetermined amino acid ("?", from `_translate`'s codon-table
fallback -- typically an "N" surviving into the reference FASTA at a CDS
position) must never enter PS1/PM5 evidence, and two "?" must never compare
equal for a synonymous determination.

Both guards were dispatched after execution against the real,
post-phase-fix (21a49cd) `FastaCodonContextProvider` and the real
`ClinVarLookup.check_same_codon_pathogenic` established two concrete
failure modes:

  SITE 1 (clinvar/lookup.py::check_same_codon_pathogenic): a bare
    truthiness check (`if wildtype_aa and mutant_aa:`) let a genuinely
    unknown "?" wildtype_aa make PM5 (novel_aa_at_known_pathogenic_codon)
    fire True against a real curated ClinVar hotspot (reproduced here with
    the same BRAF p.Val600Glu fixture already used by
    tests/test_all_fixes_regression.py's TestFix2PS1). PS1 (same_aa) was
    only accidentally safe, via `_aa3to1("?") == ""`.

  SITE 2 (annotation/codon_provider.py::_classify_snv_full): when an "N"
    sits elsewhere in the same codon (not at the variant's own position),
    it survives into BOTH ref_codon and mut_codon, so ref_aa == alt_aa ==
    "?" satisfied the classifier's first branch by plain string equality
    and reported "synonymous" -- which then fed BP7 (supporting, benign)
    for a protein change that was never actually determined. The
    discipline this guard encodes: an unknown resolving to a pathogenic-
    leaning call gets challenged by a reviewer; an unknown resolving to a
    benign one closes the case. Only one of those gets caught downstream,
    so the benign direction is the one that must not be reachable from
    "?" at all.

        also requires `spliceai_score is not None and < 0.2`, and with the
        SpliceAI VEP plugin removed that score is absent, so the conjunction
        is False and the misread reaches nothing. Measured across all four
        guard combinations: BP7 False in every one.

        CORRECTED 2026-09-10. This paragraph previously read, and was
        true when written:

            "It is reachable on an input the CALLER already annotated --
             stage.py :719-729 and :1124-1133 still parse SpliceAI= and
             DS_AG/AL/DG/DL straight out of INFO; only VEP's plugin path
             was removed (vep/stage.py:406-409). So the score is here
             deliberately: without it this test passes in both
             directions and is another control that cannot fire, which
             is exactly the fault this class was written to remove."

        Both of those INFO parses were REMOVED by the merge
        `b394bfa` ("close the SpliceAI INPUT, not another route"), which
        closed the input for licence reasons; `kim_pipeline/tests/
        test_spliceai_input_is_closed.py` guards it by asserting on ACMG
        OUTCOMES rather than on parsing. So no caller-annotated VCF can
        put a SpliceAI score on a variant any more.

        *** THIS CHANGES ONLY THE CLAIM, NOT THIS TEST. The fixture and
        the assertions below are untouched and still pass: they build
        `VariantEvidence` directly, so closing the VCF-side input never

        SpliceAI score is now gone, and by this class's own standard
        that leaves an open question -- whether a control whose

    """*** HISTORY, THEN WHAT CHANGED. ***

    This class replaces `TestTheTwoGuardsAreOneFix`, which measured (as of
    808835a) that site 1 (the equality guard in `_classify_snv_full`) and
    site 2 (the ClinVar-lookup "?" guard) had to ship together: site 1 alone
    flipped this fixture from synonymous_variant to missense_variant, which
    is exactly what routes a variant into the PS1/PM5 lookup at
    shared.py:352 -- so without site 2 standing behind that door, PM5 came
    back *** MET *** from an amino acid nobody determined.

    THIS CARD ADDS SITE 3: `_classify_snv_full` no longer reaches its
    elimination cascade (whose `else` was `missense`) for ANY codon
    involving an undetermined amino acid -- not just the equal-"?" pair
    site 1 covered. So for this fixture the door site 1 used to open is now
    never reached at all: the consequence is `not_evaluated`
    (CONSEQUENCE_NOT_DETERMINED once mapped), `is_missense` is False, and
    the PS1/PM5 lookup at shared.py:352 is gated on `is_missense` -- it is
    never called.

    Per the pin comment this class's predecessor carried: reassessing that
    pin, and the coupling it proved, is not a regression. Site 1 and site 2
    remain in place as defence in depth for any other path that might still
    hand a "?" to the lookup; they are simply no longer this fixture's story.

    notice: every other test here goes through the real provider, which

    intends.

    that returns the literal string `"not_evaluated"` and nothing else --
    isolating exactly the dependency described above. A red here names the
