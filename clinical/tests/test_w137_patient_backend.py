clinical/tests/test_w137_patient_backend.py
───────────────────────────────────────────
w137 — the patient backend audit's two confirmed, in-scope findings, proved
behaviourally.

THE TWO THINGS THIS FILE IS ABOUT, and they are different shapes:

  1. THE COVERAGE GAP. w133 built patient credential revocation and proved it
     with 61 rows, and COUNTED at 4213cd3 not one of those rows touches a
     route: `grep -l TestClient clinical/tests/*.py` does not list any
     `test_w133_*` file. So "a revoked patient's live session is refused" was
     proved of `patient_session_valid` and never of `GET /portal/me`, which is
     where a revoked patient actually arrives. Nothing was broken; nothing was
     tested either, and those are different findings. TestARevokedPatient... is
     that half.

  2. THE DEFECT. `@auditable` binds an audit row's `org_id` from a STAFF
     `Session` and from nothing else, so `terminate_my_patient_session` --
     declared `requires_session=False` because the decorator refuses a
     `PatientSession` where it is True -- wrote every `patient_session_logged
     _out` row with `org_id = NULL`. `read_audit` is Auditor-gated and filters
     `WHERE org_id = %s`. A patient session termination was therefore recorded
     where the organisation that owns it cannot look.
     TestThePatientLogoutIsAuditedInItsOwnOrganisation is that half.

     The previous wave pinned the NULL deliberately rather than hiding it, and
     the pin's own failure message says what to do about it: "the decorator now
     populates org_id for a patient-principal method -- good, and this test's
     docstring is out of date" (test_w132_logout.py). That row is rewritten,
     not deleted, in the same commit as the fix.

RULE 2a — THE METHOD, NOT A RAW QUERY. Every visibility claim in this file is
made through `DataAccess.read_audit`, the Auditor-gated reader a real
organisation would use. Nothing here concludes "the organisation can see it"
from a `SELECT` against `audit_log`. That distinction is the whole point: a
direct SELECT sees rows with `org_id IS NULL` perfectly well, so a test built
on one passes against the broken version. (Precedent: the Phase 5d
cannot-fail-test incident.)

RULE 4 — EVERY ABSENCE HAS A POSITIVE TWIN. "Organisation B's auditor cannot
see it" is satisfied by a change that files nothing anywhere, which is the
broken state. The twin is that organisation B's auditor DOES see its own
patient's logout, and A's auditor does not see that one. Neither row may be
deleted without the other.

RULE 8 — AN ORACLE CAN LIVE IN EITHER CHANNEL. The portal refusal row asserts
`(status_code, content)` as a SET OF SIZE ONE across every refusal case,
rather than case-by-case equality, so a leak in a case nobody listed still
fails.
