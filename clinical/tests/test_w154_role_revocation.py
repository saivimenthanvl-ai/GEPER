────────────────────────────────────────────
w154 (WAVE 4) — STAFF AND ROLE ADMINISTRATION, and the one thing in it that
was not wiring: ROLE REVOCATION HAD NO PRODUCTION WRITER AT ALL.

THE MEASUREMENT THIS FILE IS BUILT ON, taken at 4700f40 before a line was
written, and re-taken here by the syntax tree so it is a test rather than a
memory:

  * `revoked_at` / `revoked_by` occurred at exactly TWO non-test code sites,
    `_get_actor_role` and `get_user_roles`, and BOTH were `revoked_at IS NULL`
    READ PREDICATES.
  * THREE production sites wrote a `role_assignments` row — `assign_role`,
    `provision_organisation`, `_create_system_session` — and not one ever set
    those two columns.
  * So the platform could grant a role, and could read a revocation, and had
    no way to record one. The enforcement was complete and the state it
    enforced on was unreachable.

`TestTheProductionWriterExists` re-runs that census and asserts it now finds
exactly one writer, and its twin proves the census can return zero.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE DESIGN QUESTION, AND WHY IT IS ANSWERED BY MEASUREMENT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

One question decided the whole shape of the writer: HOW ARE ROLES RESOLVED?

If authorisation reads role assignments PER REQUEST, revocation needs no
session surgery — the next request simply fails. If roles are captured into
the session at login, revocation must deal with live sessions, and
`set_user_disabled` shows the house pattern for that.

MEASURED AT 4700f40, and the answer is unambiguous:

  * `Session` is a frozen dataclass of exactly three fields — `session_id`,
    `user_id`, `org_id`. No role.
  * `session_valid` reads ONE `sessions` row and returns those three fields.
    It does not join `role_assignments`.
  * `_require_role` calls `get_user_roles`, which reads `role_assignments`
    with `revoked_at IS NULL`, on EVERY gated call.

Roles are resolved per request. Setting `revoked_at` IS the enforcement.
Terminating the target's sessions would be a SECOND mechanism for an effect
the first one already has, and two mechanisms can disagree.

That is not what `set_user_disabled` does, and the asymmetry is the whole
point rather than an inconsistency: `users.disabled` is read by NOTHING on
the authenticated path, which is why w133 had to end sessions inside that
method's body. Enforcement did not reach; here it reaches everything.

`TestRolesAreResolvedPerRequest` proves the premise behaviourally — a LIVE
session loses the capability without being touched — and
`TestNoSecondMechanismWasBuilt` proves the conclusion structurally.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE FOUR MEASURED HAZARDS THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AGAINST
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. `@auditable` HAS NO `functools.wraps`, so `inspect.signature()` on ANY
   decorated method returns `(self, *args, **kwargs)`. Wave 3's signature
   rows passed against a wrong version outright because of it. Every claim
   here about a decorated method's parameters is read from the SYNTAX TREE,
   and `TestTheParameterReaderIsNotTheBrokenOne` proves the reader sees real,
   DIFFERING parameters on three methods rather than a constant.

2. A REFUSAL ROW ASSERTING ONLY "IT FAILED" CAN BE GREEN AGAINST BROKEN CODE.
   Every refusal here is a `(status, raw body)` pair, never a bare status and
   never a bare "it raised".

3. A MISSING PREDICATE IS INVISIBLE WHEN IDENTIFIERS CANNOT COLLIDE BY
   ACCIDENT. Two random UUIDs never collide, so the collision is CONSTRUCTED:
   `target_b` is a real user in organisation B holding a real, live Approver
   role, and organisation A names it by id.

4. REFUSAL ORDER LEAKS. Wave 2's first version answered 404 for a malformed
   id BEFORE the role gate, so a non-Administrator saw 404-vs-403 and the 403
   stopped being a function of the caller's roles alone. Every refusal claim
   here is asserted as a SET OF SIZE ONE over many inputs, never pairwise —
   and the inputs deliberately include the ones a mis-ordered implementation
   would answer differently: a malformed id, an id in another tenant, an
   unknown role name, and `System`.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE WRONG VERSIONS, AND WHICH ROW CATCHES EACH
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. REVOCATION THAT MARKS THE ROW AND LEAVES AUTHORISATION UNAFFECTED — e.g.
   a writer keyed on one `assignment_id` while the user holds two grants of
   that role.
   CAUGHT BY: `TestRolesAreResolvedPerRequest::
   test_a_live_session_loses_the_capability_the_moment_the_role_is_revoked`
   and `::test_a_duplicate_grant_does_not_survive_the_revocation`.
   VACUOUS AGAINST: a revoker that writes nothing at all but returns 0 — the
   role is still held, so those rows fail, but they would fail identically
   for a method that raised. `TestTheAuthorisedRevocationSucceeds` is the
   positive twin that distinguishes them.

B. REVOCATION THAT SUCCEEDS ACROSS ORGANISATIONS.
   CAUGHT BY: `TestTheCrossOrganisationRevocationIsRefused`, and ONLY because
   `target_b` really holds a live Approver role in B. Without that planted
   row every assertion in the class would pass against a missing `org_id`
   predicate.
   VACUOUS AGAINST: a revoker that refuses everything. The positive twin in
   the same class is what makes the refusal mean something.

C. A DISABLED ADMINISTRATOR STILL ABLE TO ACT.
   CAUGHT BY: `TestTheDisabledAdministratorCannotContinue::
   test_the_disabled_administrators_live_session_cannot_revoke_anything`,
   whose positive twin is the SAME session succeeding one request earlier.
   VACUOUS AGAINST: a revoke route that refuses every caller — again the
   positive twin is what rules that out.

D. THE AUDIT ROW NAMING THE WRONG ORGANISATION.
   THE CORRECT ANSWER, AND WHY. On a SUCCESSFUL revocation the actor's
   organisation and the target's are necessarily the same value: `org_id` is
   bound from the session, `get_user` refuses a target outside it, and the
   composite foreign key on `(user_id, org_id)` refuses the row regardless.
   They cannot differ, so "which one" is only a real question on a REFUSED
   cross-organisation attempt — and there the row belongs to the ACTOR's
   organisation. Filing it under the target's would write a row into another
   tenant's audit trail on the strength of a caller who has no standing in
   it, and organisation B's Auditor would read an event about their own user
   caused by a principal they cannot see.
   CAUGHT BY: `TestTheAuditRowNamesTheActorTheOrganisationAndTheTarget::
   test_a_refused_cross_organisation_attempt_is_filed_under_the_callers_own_org`.
   VACUOUS AGAINST: a version that writes no audit row at all for a refusal.
   `::test_the_refusal_is_recorded_at_all` is the twin for exactly that.

E. AN ADMINISTRATOR REVOKING THEIR OWN LAST ADMINISTRATOR ROLE.
   THE EXISTING RULES DO NOT SPEAK TO IT, AND THAT IS THE FINDING. There is
   no self-targeting rule anywhere in `DataAccess`: `set_user_disabled` lets
   an Administrator disable their own account and its handler says so in
   terms ("preserving an existing rule includes preserving its absence"), and
   nothing guards a "last Administrator". So the preserved behaviour is that
   it SUCCEEDS and the caller is refused on their next administrative
   request. Inventing a guard here would be widening an existing rule under
   cover of preserving it.
   CAUGHT BY: `TestTheExistingRulesArePreserved::
   test_an_administrator_may_revoke_their_own_role_and_is_refused_immediately_after`
   (which fails against a version that invents the guard) and
   `::test_structurally_the_writer_compares_no_identifier_to_the_callers_own`
   (which fails against a guard added silently later).
   VACUOUS AGAINST: nothing in the self-targeting family; it is vacuous
   against a revoker that is broken for every caller, which the positive
   twins elsewhere exclude.
