"""
Shared, mostly dependency-free helpers for the ClinGen integration:
gene-symbol normalization, resolving a variant's gene symbol via
Ensembl (ClinGen curation is gene-level, so a variant must first be
mapped to a gene before any ClinGen evidence can be looked up), and
parsing ClinGen's curated-download row formats.

The one networked helper here (`resolve_gene_symbol_detail`)
deliberately reuses `CONFIG.api.ENSEMBL_REST_BASE` and the same
`overlap/region` endpoint `pipeline/models/mmsplice/service.py`
already queries for exon annotation -- this repo's established
pattern for genome annotation lookups without a pysam/cyvcf2/gffutils
dependency -- just with `feature=gene` instead of `feature=exon`.

Allele-aware gene resolution (the fifth instance of a "first-record-
wins" bug found in this codebase, after ClinVar's record selection,
ClinVar's own retrieval narrowing, and dbSNP's rsID resolution -- see
`database/clinvar_client.py` and `database/dbsnp_client.py`'s module
docstrings for the first four)
------------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this module's `resolve_gene_symbol` took
`(coding or features)[0]` from Ensembl's overlap/region response --
the first protein-coding gene Ensembl happened to return at a
position, with zero disambiguation when more than one genuinely
overlaps. This is not hypothetical: live-confirmed, GRCh38 19:1228350
(inside the real, clinically significant Peutz-Jeghers gene STK11's
last exon) returns BOTH `STK11` (1177558-1228431, +strand) and
`CBARP` (1228282-1239465, -strand), two independent protein-coding
genes on opposite strands. Worse than the ClinVar/dbSNP cases: this
result is resolved ONCE per variant and then *reused* -- by HPO,
Orphanet, the PVS1 transcript-structure lookup, and the entire
UniProt -> InterPro -> AlphaFold chain (see `pipeline/orchestrator.py`
-- `_run_hpo_stage`/`_run_orphanet_stage`/`_run_transcript_stage`/
`_run_uniprot_stage` all reuse `clingen_result['gene_symbol']` rather
than re-resolving) -- so a wrong pick here silently corrupts every
gene-level evidence item in the report at once, not just one field.

Resolution order, each a `GeneResolutionStatus`-tagged outcome so a
caller never has to guess whether `gene_symbol=None` means "nothing
here" or "something here we refused to guess about":
  1. The VCF's own `GENE=` INFO field, when present, is trusted
     outright (`RESOLVED`, `source="vcf_gene_info"`) -- the upstream
     annotator has already done transcript-aware gene assignment; a
     coordinate-only overlap lookup has no basis to second-guess it,
     and skipping the Ensembl call entirely is also strictly cheaper.
  2. Otherwise, Ensembl overlap/region, filtered to `protein_coding`.
     Zero candidates -> `NOT_FOUND`. Exactly one -> `RESOLVED`
     (`source="ensembl_single_candidate"`), same as before.
  3. More than one protein-coding candidate: disambiguate by which
     candidate's own coding sequence (not just its gene-body span,
     which can include megabases of intron/UTR) actually contains the
     position, via the same transcript-structure machinery PVS1/PM4/
     PS1/PM5 already trust (`pipeline.pvs1.lookup.TranscriptLookup`).
     Exactly one CDS-containing candidate -> `RESOLVED`
     (`source="ensembl_cds_containment"`). Otherwise, MANE Select
     status among the tied candidates is tried as a second tie-break
     (`source="ensembl_mane_select"`). If a single winner still can't
     be determined, this is `AMBIGUOUS` -- not a coin flip, not a
     silent guess -- with every tied candidate symbol named in
     `GeneResolution.candidates` and `.reason` for the caller to
     surface honestly.
