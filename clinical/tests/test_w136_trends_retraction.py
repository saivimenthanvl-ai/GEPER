w136 — THE PATIENT REPORT SERIES, AND THE RECONCILIATION WITH RETRACTION.

WHAT THIS FILE IS ABOUT, STATED BEFORE THE FIRST ASSERTION, because the
surface under test is defined as much by what it refuses as by what it does.

THE HELD TRENDS WORK IS NOT WHAT IS TESTED HERE. `w127-trends` (tip 861e59f,
off master 9bc3abd, NOT in this branch's ancestry, read only via `git show`)
serves `GET /patients/{patient_id}/variant-trends` — a STAFF route, whose
dependency is `clinical.endpoints._get_session`, the staff session — carrying
a series of ACMG CLASSIFICATIONS read out of raw `interpretations.run_document`.
It was not merged, not ported and not rebuilt. §1 of this file asserts, as a
measurement, that none of it is served here.

WHAT IS SERVED IS `GET /portal/me/trends`: the authenticated patient's own
RELEASED reports as a series, in first-delivery order, with the amendment edge
between them. Its node key is a `report_id`.

WHY A REPORT AND NOT A VARIANT — THE WHOLE RECONCILIATION IN ONE SENTENCE.
Retraction, on the held `w122-retraction` (a4907d3), attaches to a report
(`report_retractions.report_id`). One interpretation carries MANY reports — an
amendment is a new `reports` row on the SAME `interpretation_id` — so an
interpretation-keyed trend point, which is what w127 produces, has no
retraction status at all. Human ruling E3's bargain is that the retraction
TRAVELS WITH THE DOCUMENT; a series structurally incapable of carrying it has
taken the benefit of that bargain without paying it.

AND NOTHING IS HIDDEN, which is the other half. E7: a retracted report must
not become UNFINDABLE. E3: retraction does not refuse at the release gate. So
the series applies NO retraction predicate and NO tombstone predicate — only
release — and §5 pins that.

w148: THE TABLE ARRIVED AND THE DECISION WAS MADE. Migration 0003 (2de2fef)
brought `report_retractions` into the schema; §5's measurement row fired,
naming the work it owed; and the human ruled DECISION 2 — "a trend point
originating from a retracted report REMAINS in the patient's longitudinal data
but carries an `is_retracted` flag. Do NOT expose `replacement_report_id` or
other internal retraction details." §7 is that decision, tested. No filter was
added anywhere. E4's optional replacement edge, which §5's row named as a
possibility, was refused.

WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TEST, AND WHY EACH IS ABSENT:
  * A RETRACTION CREATED THROUGH A WRITER. There is none: re-counted at
    2de2fef, `def retract_report` does not exist, and
    `enforce_content_immutability` still refuses to walk an approved report
    back at the database. §7 ARRANGES the row by direct insert — legitimate,
    because its subject is a reader — and §5 asserts the verb's continued
    absence.
  * A VARIANT CLASSIFICATION ANYWHERE. Refused — §6 proves the refusal holds
    behaviourally, with a marker that cannot arrive by coincidence.
  * A PRODUCTION PATH THAT REACHES ANY OF THIS. `_release_report` has ZERO
    non-test callers at 3a482f1, so this route returns `[]` for every patient
    in this deployment, for ever. Every released state below is constructed
    the only legitimate way there is — by calling `_release_report` behind its
    own Approver gate, with an actor separately holding Approver. No row
    forges `state = 'released'` with an UPDATE.

        Catches: a later implementer adding `AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM
        report_retractions ...)` or a tombstone filter, either of which
        contradicts E7. Checked on the shared SQL AND on the series method's
        own source, because the method could grow a Python-side filter that the
        SQL check cannot see.

        THE METHOD'S DOCSTRING IS BLANKED BEFORE SCANNING, and this row FAILED
        AGAINST CORRECT CODE until it was: `list_my_report_trend` EXPLAINS, in
        its own docstring, that it applies no retraction predicate. Prose
        saying a thing is absent must not be what makes the guard think it is
        present. Exactly the shape w135 hit in
        `test_no_portal_handler_reaches_raw_result_data`; the fix was to the
        test, and it is recorded here rather than quietly repaired.

        ─── THIS IS A GUARD AND w148 RE-AUTHORED IT. SAID PLAINLY. ───

        WHAT IT PROTECTED, in its own words above: "a later implementer adding
        `AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM report_retractions ...)` or a tombstone
        filter, either of which contradicts E7", checked on the shared SQL AND
        on the method's own Python "because the method could grow a
        Python-side filter that the SQL check cannot see". Both halves are
        about REMOVING POINTS FROM THE SERIES. The old text spelled that as
        `"retract" not in ...`, which stated the property exactly only while
        retraction could not legitimately appear at all.

        WHY IT COULD NOT STAY LITERAL: the human's decision 2 puts
        `is_retracted` on every point, and it must be derived in the ONE shared
        statement — `test_the_two_methods_share_one_sql_text` pins that
        constant's caller count at four and
        `test_every_portal_statement_binds_the_patient_from_the_session`
        requires any second statement to bind the session's patient itself. So
        the word now appears in both texts.

        THE PROPERTY STILL HOLDS, AND BOTH HALVES ARE STILL ASSERTED.
          * SQL: the statement is split at its own `FROM`; retraction must be
            PRESENT in the projection and ABSENT from every JOIN, LATERAL and
            the WHERE. A projection is computed per row already chosen by the
            FROM/WHERE — it cannot add or drop one.
          * PYTHON: instead of banning the word, every construct that could
            REMOVE AN ELEMENT is enumerated from the AST — `if`/`while` tests,
            conditional expressions, comprehension conditions, and calls to
            remove/pop/discard/filter — and none of them may mention
            retraction. A `del` statement is banned outright. That is the
            property the old line was approximating, stated directly.
        Non-vacuity for the Python half: the method is asserted to contain at
        least one `if` test, so the scan is looking at something.

        THE BEHAVIOURAL PROOF is `TestTheRetractedTrendPointIsShownAndFlagged`
        below: a really-retracted point is asserted to be still IN the series,
        in its place, flagged. Any filter re-introduced anywhere fails those.
