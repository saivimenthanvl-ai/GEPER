# Manual guard to check for held items before tree-moving operations
# Agents MUST call this before: git checkout, git reset, git rebase, git cherry-pick
#
# Usage: source bin/guard-before-tree-move.sh "<operation>" "<target-ref>" [path ...]
#   e.g. source bin/guard-before-tree-move.sh "checkout" "master"
#        source bin/guard-before-tree-move.sh "mv" "site/product" site/index.html site/product/
#
# SCOPE ARGUMENT (paths, optional):
#   Pass the paths the operation will actually touch. The guard then blocks only if an
#   uncommitted held item is REACHABLE from one of those paths. An operation that cannot
#   reach a held path is not a hazard, so it passes.
#   Pass NO paths and the operation is treated as unbounded (it could rewrite the whole
#   working tree), which is what a bare `git checkout <ref>` actually is -- so it blocks
#   while any held item is uncommitted. That is the guard working, not the guard stuck.
#
# WHAT IS EXAMINED IS DECIDED BY REACHABILITY, INCLUDING WHETHER AN ENTRY IS VALID.
#   A manifest entry the operation cannot reach is not examined at all -- not for existence,
#   not for uncommitted changes. It is not that such an entry is assumed safe; it is that
#   this operation cannot touch it either way, so there is nothing for the guard to say.
#   The earlier version validated every entry on every call, which meant a manifest naming a
#   path absent from the current checkout -- a held item exists only on the holder's machine,
#   so a fresh clone never has it -- blocked every operation, permanently, everywhere else.
#   A guard that fails on a fresh clone protects nothing there and gets deleted by whoever
#   hits it first.
#   An UNSCOPED call reaches everything, so every entry is still validated there and a
#   misspelled path is still caught loudly. Validation is deferred, never skipped.
#
# THE SCOPE IS DECLARED BY THE CALLER; THIS GUARD CANNOT VERIFY IT.
#   It has no way to know what command you run after it returns. If you declare `site/`
#   and then run an unscoped checkout, the all-clear does not cover you. Declare the widest
#   set of paths your operation can touch, not the narrowest you hope it will.
#
# NOTE: Must be sourced (source bin/guard...), not run directly (bash bin/guard...).
# Direct execution exits 2 (failure, fails closed). Do not "fix" that into exit 0.
#
# THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT. GIT CANNOT BLOCK A CHECKOUT.
#   git has no pre-checkout hook. post-checkout exists, but it fires only AFTER the working
#   tree has already been rewritten, so no hook can stop a checkout from clobbering a held
#   file. This script is therefore the ONLY coverage there is, and it is coverage only on
#   the runs where somebody actually calls it.
#   A .git/hooks/pre-checkout file used to sit in this repository reading like automatic
#   enforcement of exactly this policy. It had never run and could never run -- measured,
#   not assumed: a pre-checkout hook exiting 1 does not stop `git checkout`, while a
#   post-checkout hook in the same repository does fire. It was removed, because a
#   mechanism that cannot fire is worse than an absent one: an absent guard leaves people
#   careful, and a broken guard lets them proceed with a clean check behind them.
#   Verify this script with `bash bin/guard-tests.sh`. Do not assume something upstream is
#   catching this for you. Nothing is.
