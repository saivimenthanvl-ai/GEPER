Small, shared helpers for NCBI E-utilities HTTP handling, used by every
client that talks to eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (`database/clinvar_client.py`,
`database/dbsnp_client.py`, `pipeline/ps1_pm5/lookup.py`). Each of those
clients keeps its own `_request_json`/retry loop (an intentionally mirrored
shape, not organic duplication -- see `pipeline/ps1_pm5/lookup.py`'s module
docstring), but the two genuinely reusable pieces of logic -- interpreting
NCBI's `Retry-After` header, and recovering a response body that is valid
data but not strictly valid JSON -- live here once so a fix to either
applies identically everywhere instead of drifting between three copies.

    Parse `text` as JSON, tolerating a stray raw control character
    (e.g. a literal tab) inside a string value -- something NCBI's
    eutils responses have been observed to contain (2026-07-31: a
    ClinVar esummary/esearch response failed strict parsing with
    "Invalid control character '\\t'..."). A raw control character
    inside a JSON string is invalid per the JSON spec's strict reading
    but is a well-known, common real-world malformation -- Python's
    `json` module supports parsing it anyway via `strict=False`. This
    is a data-layer quirk to route around, not a network failure to
    retry into oblivion: the same distinction already made for
    InterPro's HTTP 204 "no domains" response (see
    `pipeline/interpro/provider.py`) -- a response that is technically
    non-conformant but semantically complete and answerable should be
    used, not discarded.

    Raises `json.JSONDecodeError` (unchanged) when the body isn't
    recoverable even leniently -- callers should let that propagate to
    their existing retry logic, since that case genuinely might be a
    transient/malformed response worth retrying.

    `source` is an optional label (typically the request URL) included
    in the warning logged when the lenient fallback is what actually
    made parsing succeed, so this doesn't silently mask malformed
    upstream data forever.

def parse_vcv_submitters(xml_text: str) -> Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Optional[str]]]]:

    Parse a ClinVar VCV-XML `efetch` response (`rettype=vcv`) into
    `{variation_id: [{"name", "org_id", "scv"}, ...]}` -- one entry per
    submitting organisation.

    Submitter identity lives ONLY here, not in the `esummary` JSON
    response `database/clinvar_client.py::ClinVarClient._esummary` and
    `pipeline/ps1_pm5/lookup.py::ClinVarCodonLookup._esummary` already
    parse (confirmed live 2026-08-16): an esummary VCV record exposes
    `supporting_submissions.scv` (bare SCV accessions, no org name),
    while this same variation's `efetch&rettype=vcv` XML carries each
    SCV's `SubmitterName`/`OrgID` on its `<ClinVarAccession>` element,
    nested under `<ClinicalAssertionList>/<ClinicalAssertion>`. Getting
    submitter identity therefore requires this second, separate
    request -- it is not an unparsed field sitting in data GEPER
    already has.

    One `VariationArchive` can carry more than one `ClinicalAssertion`
    (one per submitting lab); all are captured here rather than
    collapsed to a single name, since the record's own review-status
    star tier already communicates how ClinVar itself aggregated them
    (round 30 -- retrospective-study submitter-identity capture).

    Malformed/unparseable XML returns `{}` rather than raising -- this
    is supplementary provenance, never required for a criterion's own
    pathogenic/benign classification, and a parse failure here must
    never break the caller's classification-relevant esearch/esummary
