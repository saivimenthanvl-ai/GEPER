──────────────────────────────
THE MIGRATION TEST DATABASE LIFECYCLE, and it is a different lifecycle from
every other database test in this package ON PURPOSE.

THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS TO CLOSE. `clinical/tests/db_guard.py::reset_schema`
and its twenty-six inlined copies begin with `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;` and then load `schema.sql`. A migration test that asks
one of those fixtures for a database is handed a FRESHLY CREATED one, built
from the current `schema.sql` a few lines earlier -- so every assertion about
"the upgrade worked" passes for the wrong reason, and would keep passing
against a runner that does nothing at all. That is the house pattern, in
twenty-six files, so the accident is the DEFAULT and avoiding it by
remembering to is not good enough.

SO THESE TESTS NEVER TOUCH THE SHARED SCHEMA. They CREATE THEIR OWN DATABASE
on the same server, run the whole scenario inside it, and DROP the database at
the end. Nothing here calls `reset_schema`, nothing here executes
`DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE`, and the existing fixtures are left exactly as
they are -- this is a path BESIDE them, not a replacement for them.

AND THE ISOLATION IS NOT THE PROOF EITHER. A test can still be handed a
brand-new database by accident. The structural proof is the SENTINEL: before
an upgrade, a caller writes a marker that a drop-and-recreate cannot carry
across -- `plant_sentinel` below -- and asserts afterwards that it is still
there, BY CONTENT. A dropped and recreated database loses it; there is no way
to fake surviving one. Paired, always, with the opposite assertion that the
new object the migration was for is actually present, because a marker-only
test passes against a runner that does nothing.

THE DISPOSABLE GUARD IS UNTOUCHED AND UNWEAKENED. `clinical/tests/conftest.py`
still refuses the whole session without `CLINICAL_TEST_DB_DISPOSABLE=1` before
any connection is opened; these helpers run after that gate like everything
else. They create and drop databases OF THEIR OWN on that server and never
drop the one the DSN names.

#   * an `organisations` row -- REAL clinical data in a REAL table the
#     migration set does not touch. Its survival is the property an operator
#     actually cares about.
#   * a table of its own -- which also survives a `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE`
#     being replaced by a schema rebuild only if nothing was dropped, and
#     which no schema.sql anywhere creates, so a database rebuilt from
#     schema.sql cannot have it by any route.

# Both are asserted BY CONTENT. A count of one is satisfied by a freshly
# inserted placeholder; the specific name is not.
