clinical/tests/test_exception_endpoints_http.py
───────────────────────────────────────────────
THE FIRST HTTP-LEVEL TEST IN THIS REPOSITORY. Not a gap filled in an existing
file -- a layer that had never been exercised at all.

`test_exception_endpoints.py` sits next to this one and, despite its name,
contains no `TestClient`, no app and no `dependency_overrides`: all eleven of
its tests call `DataAccess` methods directly. It is a good data-layer test file
wearing an endpoint name. That is why F1 survived inside a file named for the
thing it broke -- `_get_session` and `_get_data_access` both raised
`NotImplementedError` on every request, and nothing asked. A test file named
for a layer it does not touch is worse than no test file, because it answers
"is this covered?" with a yes.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS, and the three claims are kept apart because they fail
independently:

  1. THE ROUTES ANSWER AT ALL. Each of the three is called through a real
     TestClient against a real bootstrapped database and gets a real response.
     Before the change every one of them was a 500.
  2. THE ACTOR CANNOT BE ASSERTED BY THE CALLER (F2). Sending an `actor` in
     the body does not make it the actor -- the recorded one is the session's
     user, and the caller's string appears nowhere.
  3. `DataAccess` IS REQUEST-SCOPED (the ruling). Two sequential requests get
     two different instances. This is the only test that stops someone
     helpfully re-adding the singleton the old docstring asked for, which
     would silently reintroduce cross-request transaction bleed.

THE APP IS NO LONGER TEST-LOCAL. This file used to build its own `FastAPI()`
and mount the router, because no clinical application object existed; it said
so, and said the swap would be a one-line change. `clinical/app.py` now exists
and the swap has been made. Everything below therefore runs against THE OBJECT
THE SERVICE ACTUALLY SERVES, not a stand-in that happens to mount the same
router -- and for as long as the stand-in was the only `include_router` in the
repository, these nine tests were green against a service that did not exist.
