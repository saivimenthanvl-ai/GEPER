Bij AI variant-interpretation component (GEPER) structural-annotation FastAPI application.

Endpoints
---------
GET /structures/{accession}  — AlphaFold DB structural annotation for one
                                 variant's mapped residue (the 3D viewer's
                                 data endpoint)

Scope, deliberately narrow: this app exists to serve the one endpoint above.
No health-check surface has been added beyond what that endpoint itself
needs to run -- still an open, separately-owned question (see the
2026-08-23 hive design/implementation dispatch).

Auth/CORS (2026-09-02): ported from kim_pipeline/api/main.py's fail-to-start
control (that app's GAP 2 / FIX #3) so both FastAPI apps in this monorepo
share one posture -- refuses to start without GEPER_API_KEYS +
GEPER_CORS_ORIGINS unless GEPER_DEV_INSECURE=1 is set explicitly. This app
had been left fail-open since the 2026-08-23 dispatch above: when this app
was split out as Option A, auth/CORS were deferred as an open question here
rather than reusing the control kim_pipeline had already shipped -- nobody
revisited it when this app was stood up, not a considered decision to run
without one.

Architecture note (why this lives in geper/, not kim_pipeline/api/): ruled
2026-08-23 as Option A. kim_pipeline/api/main.py is the monorepo's only
other FastAPI app, but kim_pipeline has no structural code and geper/ and
kim_pipeline/ run as separate subprocesses with no shared Python process
(see bridge/combined_pipeline.py's own docstring) -- serving this from
kim_pipeline would mean either creating an in-process dependency that does
not exist, or geper persisting structural data for kim_pipeline to read,
which is what today's pass-through design avoids. This endpoint lives next
to the data, the mapping gate, and the provenance that produce it.

RESOLVED (2026-08-26, human ruling, route c): `mapping_status` splits two
distinct causes of "found, but no residue-level confidence" --
`NO_POSITION` (no protein position was ever resolved for this variant) vs.
`NOT_MAPPABLE` (a real position existed but the mapping gate rejected it on
the merits: out of span / not modelled / fragment-numbering mismatch) --
using the raw result's own `protein_position` field: `None` means
NO_POSITION, non-None means NOT_MAPPABLE. This needed no `mapping_gate.py`
change and no reason-string pattern-matching, because `protein_position` is
echoed unconditionally by `provider.py::_build_annotation` regardless of the
gate's verdict -- the only two constructors reached along the `found=True`
path (`LocalDatasetAlphaFoldProvider.query`, `LiveAPIAlphaFoldProvider.query`)
both pass it through. The two non-echoing constructors,
`AlphaFoldAnnotation.not_found`/`.from_error`, never reach this branch at
all: they set `found=False`, which is handled above and mapped to
`EntryStatus.NOT_FOUND`/`ERROR` before `mapping_status` is ever considered.
Confirmed by execution, not by reading alone, before this was implemented
(constructed the case: a non-None `protein_position` the gate rejects for a
non-NO_POSITION reason, e.g. out-of-span -- the raw dict's `protein_position`
stayed the non-None value, never collapsed to `None`). See
`tests/test_api_structures.py`'s `TestMapToResponseFoundNoPosition`/
`TestMapToResponseFoundNotMappable` for the pinned fixtures.
