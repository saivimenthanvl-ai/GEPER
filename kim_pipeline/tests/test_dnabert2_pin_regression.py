──────────────────────────────────────
Regression test for DNABERT-2's moving-ref RCE surface (pipeline/ai/engine.py,
DnaBertEngine._load): DNABERT-2 requires trust_remote_code=True (its MosaicBERT/
ALiBi/FlashAttention architecture ships as custom Python in the HF repo, not in
the transformers library), which without a revision pin would execute whatever
code sits on the repo's default branch at load time -- something the repo owner,
or an attacker who compromises their account, could silently repoint to
something malicious after review. The fix pins both the tokenizer and model
loads to a specific, reviewed commit (see DATA_PROVENANCE.md) when loading the
default repo, while leaving an operator-supplied model_name (e.g. a local fork)
unpinned so a stale pin can't break a deliberate override.

Mirrors tests/test_torchaudio_pin_regression.py's own rationale (a moving/
unpinned dependency ref reintroducing a fixed class of bug) but not its
mechanics -- this exercises a live loader call rather than static source
analysis, so it fakes out the torch/transformers import points entirely
(pipeline.ai.engine._try_import_torch/_try_import_transformers) and inspects
the from_pretrained call kwargs. No real model download, no dependency on
torch/transformers actually being installed in the environment running this
test.
