tests/test_fastq_scanner.py
───────────────────────────

The FASTQ scanner: a scheduled, READ-ONLY sweep of
`{GEPER_FASTQ_ROOT}/{org_id}/incoming/` that writes `fastq_sets` rows.

WHAT THE TESTS GO THROUGH. Every test below calls `FastqScanner.scan_org()`
and asserts on what it returns or on what the database then holds. None of them
reaches past the scanner to set up the state they are checking. That is the
Phase 5d trap stated as a habit rather than a warning: a test that calls
`db_session.execute()` INSTEAD OF the code under test verifies the database and
passes while the code is broken.

THE IDEMPOTENCY KEY IS THE CHECKSUM PAIR, NOT THE PATH (human ruling,
2026-09-08). This is why the table deliberately carries no
`UNIQUE (org_id, r1_path)`: a moved or renamed file with the same content is
THE SAME OBSERVATION, and a reused path with new content is a DIFFERENT one, so
a path-based constraint would have been wrong in both directions. Both
directions are tested -- `test_the_same_pair_under_a_different_name_is_not_a_new_row`
and `test_a_reused_path_with_new_content_is_a_new_row` -- because either alone
is consistent with keying on the wrong thing.

ORG SCOPING: ANOTHER ORG'S SAMPLE MUST BE **INDISTINGUISHABLE** FROM UNKNOWN,
not merely refused. A distinct outcome for "exists but not yours" tells a caller
which sample ids exist in another organisation. So the test asserts the two
outcomes are EQUAL TO EACH OTHER rather than equal to a literal string -- it
keeps holding if the wording changes, and it fails if the two ever diverge.

SIZE STABILITY EXISTS FOR ONE REASON, and it is not tidiness: A FILE STILL BEING
WRITTEN HAS A VALID NAME AND A READABLE PREFIX. Without the check the scanner
ingests half a sequencing run and everything downstream is confidently wrong
about complete data. So the first sighting of a set is never ingested -- it is
deferred until a later scan sees the same size.

READ-ONLY IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED: the scanner never deletes and never moves.
`test_the_scanner_moves_and_deletes_nothing` snapshots the tree before and after
and compares names, sizes and contents.
