"""
clinical/endpoints.py
─────────────────────
Clinical platform exception workflow public API.

Three endpoints for exception management:
1. GET /orders/{id}/exceptions — list all exceptions for an order (open + resolved)
2. GET /exceptions/worklist — worklist of open exceptions by owner
3. PATCH /exceptions/{id} — resolve an exception

Exception workflow vocabulary is immutable after create time:
- category: PRECONDITION_FAILURE | VALIDATION_FAILURE | TRANSIENT_SUBMISSION_FAILURE | INTERPRETATION_FAILURE
- reason_code: closed vocabulary mapping to owners and categories (see models/exception.py)
- owner: orderer | lab_operator (determined by reason_code)
- status: open | resolved

NOTE: These endpoints assume a SessionMiddleware or equivalent has injected
an authenticated session into the request context. The session is used to
enforce organisation isolation (org-scoped queries).

    last_resolved_by` and to the `exception_events` row -- so the same
    statement scoped the update by something trusted (`session.org_id`) and
    attributed it by something the caller supplied. Under ISO 15189 the record
    of who performed an action is evidence, and a claimed actor is
    indistinguishable in the log from a verified one, which makes it worse
    than a missing one: the audit trail looks complete.

    The actor is now derived from the authenticated session. Validating a
    caller-supplied actor would not have been enough -- a validated claim is
    still a claim -- so the field is removed rather than checked. This is the
    rule `Session`'s own docstring already states for `org_id`: read from the
    session and never from a caller argument, "which is what makes the
    isolation structural rather than remembered". The actor now obeys the rule
    the organisation already obeyed.

    raise NotImplementedError under a docstring saying "initialize DataAccess
    with postgres connection pool, cache as singleton". That plan cannot be
    safely executed with `DataAccess` as written, and implementing it
    faithfully would have shipped a correctness defect:

      `data_access.transactional` gates on INSTANCE state -- `if
      self._in_transaction: return func(...)`, documented as "nested calls
      within a transaction pass through". That is right for a call chain

      requests it is not: a second request arriving while the first holds the
      flag is treated as a nested call, opens no transaction of its own, and
      request A's `commit()` commits request B's half-finished work -- then
      `finally: self._in_transaction = False` clears the flag while B is
      still running, so the next request misjudges too. On the path whose
      entire purpose is recording who did what.

    Nothing in the suite would have caught that: no test exercises two
    concurrent requests. The decorator is not wrong; the singleton plan was,
    and it sat in a placeholder where it read as a decision someone had made.

    A connection pool is the production form of this same answer --
    `pool.connection()` per request -- so nothing here forecloses one. What
    must not come back is a shared, cached instance.
