        Records the provenance of a run whose variants this one is
        REUSING rather than recomputing (`pipeline/orchestrator.py`'s
        resume-from-checkpoint path).

        Why this exists: resume merges a prior document's variant
        results into this run's builder, but every run-level field on
        that builder -- `model_checkpoints`, `code_version`,
        `service_health`, `generated_at` -- is this run's. So a resumed
        document stated a model set, a code version and a timestamp
        under which the carried-forward variants were never processed,
        and nothing marked the difference: a merged document was
        indistinguishable from a clean one. That is a false claim, not
        a gap, and no amount of scanning the output could detect it.

        The prior values were never missing. The resume path already
        loads the whole prior document and reads only its `variants`
        key; everything below was sitting in that same object and was
        being dropped. This keeps it instead of collecting anything new.

        THREE STATES, NOT TWO -- a resumed run has stages that ran now,
        stages carried forward from a prior run, and stages whose prior
        value is unknowable:

        * `carried_forward` -- the prior document recorded its
          checkpoints and they are preserved here verbatim. An
          empty-but-present map stays `carried_forward`: that run DID
          answer the question, and demoting it to unknown would discard
          a real answer.
        * `prior_value_unknown` -- the prior document has no
          `model_checkpoints` key at all, because it was written before
          this field existed. Every document already on disk when this
          shipped is in this state. Rendering it as `carried_forward`
          with an empty map would claim the earlier run recorded
          nothing, when the truth is that it was never asked -- the
          same absent-vs-unrecorded distinction `report/summary.py`'s
          QC handling and the tri-state VAF work both turn on.

        A list, not a single entry: resume can chain (a run resumed
        from a run that was itself resumed), and each link is its own
        provenance record. Appending is additive for every consumer.
