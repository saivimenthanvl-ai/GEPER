──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MIGRATION 0003 -- THE FIRST REAL THIRD MIGRATION, AND THE FIRST REAL TEST OF
THE GENERATION-INVARIANT LIMITATION w146 WROTE DOWN.

`test_w146_generation_survives_a_third_migration.py` demonstrated six-state
discrimination with a THROWAWAY three-migration set in `tmp_path`, and said
plainly what it could not see: `/readyz` calls `migrate.discover()` itself and
cannot be handed a pinned set, so a throwaway set never reaches the probe.
`clinical/migrations/0003_report_retraction.sql` is the first set member that
is really on disk, so the rows here are the ones that run through the real
`discover()` -- the real file, the real checksum, the real stamp in
`clinical/schema.sql`, and the real `(3, "report_retraction")` key in
`_GENERATION_INVARIANTS`.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT TEST, AND WHY THAT IS NOT AN OMISSION. 0003 lands
SCHEMA. The `retract_report` verb, the report builder's retraction banners and
the patient-facing `is_retracted` flag are NOT in this repository at this
commit, so nothing here writes a retraction, reads one back, or asserts
anything about what a patient is shown. Two rows in
`test_w135_patient_report_access.py` and `test_w136_trends_retraction.py` go
RED the moment these tables appear; that is their designed behaviour and they
were left standing rather than weakened -- see this wave's report.

A THIRD ROW GOES RED AND IT IS NOT A TRIPWIRE, IT IS A BLOCKER THIS WAVE MAY
NOT CLEAR. `test_identity.py::test_org_scoped_table_coverage_is_derived_from_
the_schema` derives the org-owned table set FROM `clinical/schema.sql` and
checks it against `clinical/data_access.py::ORG_SCOPED_TABLES`. Both new
tables carry `org_id`, so neither may be exempted -- the interlock in
`test_only_a_table_without_an_org_id_column_may_be_exempt` permits an
exemption only where the column genuinely does not exist, which is the route
`schema_migrations` legitimately took in w126m and the route these two cannot.
The fix is two string literals in `ORG_SCOPED_TABLES`, and
`clinical/data_access.py` is an APPLICATION FILE, which this wave is forbidden
to touch. Measured, so the size of the blocker is on the record rather than
guessed: `ORG_SCOPED_TABLES` has no runtime consumer anywhere in `clinical/`
or `geper/` -- its only readers are `test_identity.py` and
`test_patient_identity.py` -- so adding the two names changes no behaviour.
The wave that brings `retract_report` across owns that file and should do it
there. The row is left RED, naming the two tables, deliberately.

THE WRONG VERSIONS THIS FILE WAS BUILT AGAINST. Each row below names the one
it catches AND the one it is vacuous against; these are the five the brief
enumerates:

  A  0003 adds the objects but declares NO generation invariant
  B  the invariants are written against `information_schema`, not `pg_catalog`
  C  an "upgrade" test that passes because the fixture rebuilt the database
  D  0003 applied before 0002
  E  a privilege statement omitted, so `clinical_app` cannot read the new table

THESE TESTS CREATE THEIR OWN DATABASES (`clinical/tests/migration_db.py`) and
never touch the package's drop-and-recreate fixtures, for the reason that
module's docstring gives at length: a fixture that rebuilds from the current
`schema.sql` destroys the one property an upgrade test is about.

        AND A MEASUREMENT THAT NARROWS THE STANDING CLAIM, recorded here
        rather than left as prose. `clinical/migrate.py` says an
        `information_schema` invariant "would report a present object as

        passes when the two are EQUAL, which is what they are. Measured on a

        holds at least one privilege on ALL 31 tables in this schema, so
        `information_schema` hides NOTHING from it and an information_schema
        invariant would not fail readiness today. `clinical_retention` is the

             `information_schema` too, so the pg_catalog rule is
             defence-in-depth here and not a live fix. If a future REVOKE
             changes that, this row goes red and the claim gets revisited
             instead of quietly becoming true again;
