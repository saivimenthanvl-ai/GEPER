"""
Tests for QC-metrics durability across review/signoff.py re-renders
(two related cards, landed together, tested together per the
dispatch):

CARD 1: review/signoff.py's approve()/override() now read
document["qc_metrics"] and pass it through to generate_pdf() when
re-rendering after sign-off -- previously they re-rendered with NO
qc_metrics argument at all, regardless of what the original run had.

CARD 2: report/json_builder.py now stores qc_metrics on the document
itself (not only ever as a transient generate_pdf() argument), so a
later re-render (days later, from disk, with no access to the
original --qc-metrics-json file) can still recover it.

THE DANGEROUS CASE, named explicitly in the dispatch: a run WITH real
qc_metrics, once approved/overridden, must NOT render the "no QC
observed" text -- that text is a POSITIVE, specific claim ("GEPER
never ran or observed any upstream sequencing/alignment step") that
becomes FALSE the moment a run that DID have QC gets signed off and
silently re-rendered without it. Asserting its absence specifically
(not just asserting the real QC table's presence) is what actually
catches the regression -- a renderer could show the real QC table AND
also, by accident, leave stale/duplicate no-QC text somewhere else.

Written against OBSERVABLE OUTPUT: the actual rendered PDF text after
a real approve()/override() call, never against internals. Reuses
tests/test_signoff.py's own fixtures rather than a second hand-rolled
one, same reasoning that module's own docstring gives.

CARD A7 (extended into this same file rather than a parallel suite,
per the dispatch -- this file already encodes the exact contract, just
for the PDF path): QC metrics never reach the Markdown renderer at
all. `report/report_generator.py` has zero mentions of "qc" anywhere
in it (confirmed by grep before writing these tests) -- a run WITH
real QC and a run genuinely WITHOUT any produce byte-identical
Markdown today, because neither the real table nor the honest
"no QC observed" fallback text is ever printed. That is the actual
defect: not merely "QC is missing from Markdown" but "present and
absent QC are indistinguishable in Markdown," which is worse than
either alone (a reader cannot tell "QC wasn't collected" from "the
renderer just doesn't cover this"). `TestA7MarkdownRendersQcMetrics`
below pins the same two-sided contract this file already pins for the
PDF path: a run WITH qc_metrics must render the real values, and a
run genuinely WITHOUT must still print the same honest fallback text
PDF already uses (`_NO_QC_OBSERVED_TEXT` below) -- never silence in
either direction.
