SPiP plugin -- real integration (not a placeholder).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
License verification summary (same convention as SpliceFormerPlugin/
SpliceBERTPlugin/EnformerPlugin/BorzoiPlugin -- repeated here so this
file is self-contained):

  - Official implementation: github.com/LBGC-CFB/SPiP (also mirrored
    under github.com/raphaelleman/SPiP, the primary author's own
    account -- same content), the tool described in Leman et al.,
    "SPiP: Splicing Prediction Pipeline, a machine learning based tool
    for splicing prediction", Human Mutation 43(12), 2308-2323 (2022),
    https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.24491.
  - License: MIT, confirmed by reading the repository's own `LICENSE`
    file directly ("MIT License ... Copyright (c) 2020 raphaelleman")
    and by the per-file copyright/permission header
    `SPiPv2.1_main.r` itself carries (Copyright 2019 Center Francois
    Baclesse and Normandie University -- same permissive terms,
    reproduced verbatim in the vendored copy). Covers both the R
    source and its bundled small reference tables
    (`VPP_table.txt`/`VPN_table.txt`).
  - Reference/sequence data (`model.RData`, `RefFiles.RData`,
    `dataRefSeq<genome>.RData`, `transcriptome_<genome>.RData` --
    downloaded separately at load time, see
    `pipeline/models/spip/loader.py`): derived from NCBI RefSeq
    transcript annotation and the hg19/hg38 reference genome
    assemblies, both public-domain US-government/public genome-
    browser data with no additional redistribution restriction --
    distinct from a third party's own proprietary model weights, the
    same category of "reference data", not "someone else's IP", every
    other GEPER stage that reads RefSeq/genome coordinates (VCF
    parsing, BLAST, gnomAD/ClinVar lookups) already relies on.
  - Net result: commercially usable and redistributable (MIT:
    attribution + license notice preserved). No copyleft concern.

Implementation note (why this plugin looks completely different from
every other plugin in this family): SPiP is not a PyTorch model --
it's an R script (`SPiPv2.1_main.r`) that runs a randomForest
classifier cascading several splicing-prediction components (SPiCE,
MaxEntScan, Branch Point Predictor, ESR/ESE/ESS hexamer scoring),
reimplemented natively in R (confirmed by reading the vendored source
directly: no `system()`/`shell()` calls anywhere, so there's no
*separate* external tool binary to install beyond R itself). GEPER
vendors the official, unmodified R source
(`pipeline/models/spip/vendor/`) and invokes it as a subprocess via
`Rscript`, the same way a user would run it standalone, then parses
its tab-delimited output back into this plugin's usual result shape
-- the same "vendor the real official source, don't reimplement it"
principle SpliceFormerPlugin already applies, extended one level
further (a subprocess boundary instead of an in-process `nn.Module`)
because the official implementation isn't in Python/PyTorch at all.
This mirrors the subprocess-isolation pattern already established
elsewhere in this very codebase for a foreign-language integration --
see `bridge/combined_pipeline.py`'s own module docstring (Kim
pipeline, a separate Python environment) for the same rationale
applied to a different cross-language boundary (there: two Python
processes with incompatible dependency sets; here: Python calling R).

Input-contract note (why `_infer_impl` needs more than ref_seq/alt_seq):
every other plugin in this family scores a fixed-length sequence
*window* (ref vs alt) with no awareness of real exon/intron
boundaries. SPiP is the opposite: its whole value is resolving a
variant's effect against the *actual* annotated transcript structure
(nearest splice site, branch point, reading frame) via a bundled
RefSeq database -- it fundamentally needs genomic coordinates, not
just flanking sequence, to do that lookup. `ref_seq`/`alt_seq` are
still accepted as the first two positional arguments purely for
call-signature consistency with `ModelManager.predict(key, *args,
**kwargs)`'s existing usage pattern across this plugin family; they
are unused. Callers must instead pass `chrom=`, `pos=`, `ref=`,
`alt=` kwargs (the same fields a VCF row carries), which this plugin
writes into a minimal one-variant VCF and hands to SPiP exactly the
way its own VCF input mode works.

Ensemble/evidence-aggregation note: like SpliceFormer/SpliceBERT, this
plugin is deliberately NOT added to `pipeline/models/ensemble.py`'s
Enformer+Borzoi consensus. UNLIKE SpliceFormer/SpliceBERT, SPiP is not
otherwise wired in either: not passed to `InterpretationEngine`/ACMG
evaluation of any criterion (not just PP3/BP4), not added to
`pipeline/models/status.py`'s "AI Models" display table, and not
called from any per-variant stage in `pipeline/orchestrator.py` -- see
`pipeline/models/pending_plugins.py`'s module docstring for how
SpliceFormer/SpliceBERT differ from SPiP on this point. It is
reachable via `ModelManager` (through
`pipeline.models.pending_plugins.build_default_registry()`) for
direct/programmatic use and tests, exactly like SpliceFormer/SpliceBERT.
