─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MIGRATION 0004 -- THE EXCEPTION-AMENDMENT RELATIONSHIP, TENANT-BOUND, AND THE
CROSS-ORGANISATION ROW PROVED INEXPRESSIBLE BY ATTEMPTING THE WRITE.

THE ONE THING TO READ FIRST. The human's row 2 -- "cross-org amendment fails"
-- is NOT proved by asking the catalogue whether a constraint exists. A
catalogue assertion is satisfied by a constraint that is present and
unenforced, and by a constraint whose columns are not the ones anybody
believes. Every row in `TestTheSixRequiredRows` below ATTEMPTS THE WRITE
against a real PostgreSQL server and asserts the server's own verdict,
including its SQLSTATE.

AND THE SQLSTATE IS NOT DECORATION. At 4d16b8f -- before this migration --
`exception_events` has no `amends_event_id` column at all, so the cross-org
INSERT below fails with 42703 (undefined_column). A row asserting only "this
raises" would be GREEN on the pre-fix code, for a reason that has nothing to
do with tenancy. That is the shape w148 measured in the other direction: a
missing predicate invisible to every behavioural row because the identifiers
could not collide by accident. Here the identifiers collide BY CONSTRUCTION --
the amendment names another organisation's REAL, PLANTED event id, and the
test asserts that id genuinely exists before attempting to reference it -- and
the refusal must be 23503 (foreign_key_violation) specifically. Measured
against the four wrong versions this wave built (A, B, D and the pre-fix tip);
the results are in the wave report.

WHAT 0004 LANDS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Three objects: a UNIQUE
key over (org_id, id), a nullable `amends_event_id UUID`, and the COMPOSITE
self-foreign key `(amends_event_id, org_id) -> exception_events (id, org_id)`.
It does NOT add `'amend_resolution'` to the `action` CHECK, and it does not add
the held branch's CHECK tying the action to the column: widening an inline
CHECK is DROP-then-ADD, which is destructive, and the derivation MEASURED that
this is exactly where the held branch stops being additive (5 opcodes, 18
inserted lines, one `replace`). So after this migration an amendment row is
STRUCTURALLY POSSIBLE AND TENANT-BOUND, and NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY WRITES
ONE -- `amends_event_id` appears in no INSERT outside this file. The
relationship is landed and proved; the verb is the next authorisation's.

THE WRONG VERSIONS THIS FILE WAS BUILT AGAINST. Each row names the one it
catches AND the one it is vacuous against:

  A  the held branch's SINGLE-COLUMN self-FK  (REFERENCES exception_events (id))
  B  the composite FK added WITHOUT the unique key -- must fail to create
  C  `org_id` omitted from an amendment insert
  D  the unique key added but the FK left single-column: the catalogue carries
     a constraint of the right NAME on the right table, and is wrong
  E  a migration that adds the objects but declares no generation invariant

THESE TESTS CREATE THEIR OWN DATABASES (`clinical/tests/migration_db.py`) for
everything about the migration mechanism, for the reason that module's
docstring gives: a fixture that rebuilds from the current `schema.sql`
destroys the one property an upgrade test is about. The six behavioural rows
use the package's ordinary `DROP SCHEMA`/`schema.sql` fixture, because their
subject is the CURRENT schema and their two organisations are built through
`DataAccess` -- the same path `test_w129_exception_tenant_isolation.py` uses,
and its `_org_with_admin` / `_order_for` helpers are imported here rather than
copied so the two files cannot drift.

        longer true that "nothing forces a migration to declare" — every

        THE POINT OF THE WAVE. Organisation B writes an event into its OWN
        exception, in its OWN org partition -- everything about the row is B's

        surface of a single-column self-reference: nothing about the row is
        cross-tenant except the one column that matters.

        THE TARGET IS PROVED TO EXIST FIRST. Without that, this refusal could
        be the same refusal an invented id gets (row 3), and the row would be
        vacuous for the reason w148 measured: identifiers that cannot collide
        by accident make a missing predicate invisible.

        AND THE SQLSTATE IS ASSERTED. On the pre-fix tip (4d16b8f) there is no
        `amends_event_id` column, so this statement raises 42703 and a row
        asserting only "it raises" would be GREEN AGAINST THE CODE THIS WAVE

        MEASURED BY CATALOGUE QUERY, not by grep -- a text search cannot see a
        named CONSTRAINT, a separate CREATE UNIQUE INDEX, or a primary key that
        is not called `id`, which is exactly why the earlier census claim was
        wrong. Seven tables lack the key after this wave and are listed by
        name, so a later wave that "helpfully" fixes one has to edit this list.
