tests/test_orchestrator_threads_gene_identity.py
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

Human dispatch (conv-orchestrator-gene-identity, 2026-09-10): closes the
gap Andy's own merged suite (`tests/test_sevengene_acceptance_suite.py`)
names explicitly in its own docstring -- his tests call
`LiveAPIClinGenProvider().query(gene_symbol)` / `LiveAPIHPOProvider()
.query(gene_symbol)` / `ErepoFunctionalEvidenceProvider()
.fetch_gene_index(gene_symbol)` DIRECTLY, with an explicit gene
argument he varies himself. That proves the PROVIDERS thread gene
identity when handed it. It cannot prove the ORCHESTRATOR actually
hands them the real one: the seam Andy's suite structurally cannot see
is the layer between "a variant's gene was resolved" and "a provider
was called with it".

THE EXACT SEAM, NAMED (found by reading, not assumed): every one of the
gene-keyed stage wrappers in `pipeline/orchestrator.py` re-derives its
own gene symbol from the ClinGen stage's already-resolved result,
independently, in a line that looks like this --

  `_run_hpo_stage` (line ~2753):
      gene_symbol = (clingen_result or {}).get("gene_symbol")
  `_run_functional_evidence_stage` (line ~3010):
      gene_symbol = (clingen_result or {}).get("gene_symbol")

-- and THIS is the layer nothing tests: if either of these lines were
mutated to hold a constant, an empty string, or None instead of really
reading `clingen_result["gene_symbol"]`, no existing test (including
Andy's) would go red, because nothing drives these two orchestrator
methods with a REAL, resolved `clingen_result` built from a REAL
variant.

THE ORCHESTRATOR ENTRY POINT CHOSEN, AND WHY: `GeperPipeline
._run_clingen_stage` chained into `._run_hpo_stage` (and, for a second,
independent proof of the identical defect shape,
`._run_functional_evidence_stage`) -- called directly on a real
(if minimally-constructed) `GeperPipeline` instance, exactly the two
consecutive calls `_process_variant` itself makes
(`clingen_result = self._run_clingen_stage(...)`, then
`hpo_result = self._run_hpo_stage(clingen_result, errors)`). This is
the narrowest real entry point that actually contains the seam: going
one level up to `_process_variant` itself would require constructing
DNA/RNA model routing, sequence context generation, and a dozen other
unrelated stages this task has no interest in, for no additional
coverage of the actual defect class -- the two stage methods ARE the
orchestrator layer in question. (Same reasoning
`test_orchestrator_empty_error_still_recorded.py` already used to
justify calling stage methods directly on a bare
`GeperPipeline.__new__` instance rather than the full pipeline.)

WHY GENE RESOLUTION ITSELF NEEDS NO NETWORK MOCKING (fully offline,
deterministic, confirmed by reading `pipeline/clingen/utils.py::
resolve_gene_symbol_detail`): resolution prefers the VCF's own `GENE=`
INFO field over any Ensembl overlap lookup, and returns immediately
when present -- no network call happens at all. So two `Variant`
objects differing only in `info={"GENE": ...}` resolve deterministically
to two different gene symbols via REAL, unmodified orchestrator/ClinGen
code, with nothing mocked at that layer.

RED-FIRST, THE SHAPE THIS TASK ACTUALLY HAS (declared before touching
anything, per the dispatch's own anticipation): the orchestrator
ALREADY threads gene identity correctly today -- nothing here is
broken, so there is no natural "fails against current code, passes
after a fix" cycle the way a genuine defect fix would have. GREEN IS
EMPTY: no production line changes in this branch. The red-first
discipline this task actually calls for is the dispatch's own
acceptance criterion instead -- INTRODUCE THE DEFECT IN PRODUCTION ON
PURPOSE (mutate `_run_hpo_stage`'s gene_symbol line to a constant, and
separately `_run_functional_evidence_stage`'s identical line, one at a
time), declare in writing what is expected, run, confirm the RELEVANT
test below goes red WHILE THE OTHER STAYS GREEN (proving each test is
specific to its own stage, not accidentally sensitive to any change
anywhere), then revert and confirm both green again. Both mutations
were performed and reverted; neither is committed anywhere (same
practice the dispatch names -- "Pam mutated production in place
tonight ... and reverted before committing") -- see the dispatch report
for the full transcript of both. Without this step, this file would be
exactly the failure mode the dispatch warns about: "if your test stays
green under a broken orchestrator, you have built Andy's suite again
one layer up." IT ALMOST WAS: see `_first_gene_specific_capture`'s own
docstring below for a self-caught bug that made the FIRST version of
this file's HPO test pass for the wrong reason even under the
deliberate defect, found only by actually running this exact
mutate-and-confirm step rather than trusting the test on inspection
alone.

BASELINE (measured on my own instrument, not taken from anyone else --
standing rule after tonight's CI-figure mismatch, and MY OWN INSTANCE
OF THE SAME MISTAKE, caught before it reached a report: I first carried
forward 2497 -- my own review_required task's number, measured at a
DIFFERENT commit, 1cee993/da35c979 -- as if it were this branch's
baseline at abaa7c96, without re-measuring. It was not: `geper/tests`
actually collects/passes 2504 at master abaa7c96 with this file absent
(confirmed by moving this file aside and re-running immediately before
writing this sentence), not 2497. This file's own delta is stated in
the dispatch report, not here -- but the number it is a delta FROM is
2504.)
