──────────────────────────────────────────────────
w155 (WAVE 5) — PATIENT ENROLMENT AND CREDENTIAL OPERATIONS, through the
administrative surface, tested as BEHAVIOUR through the app the service
actually serves (`clinical.app`).

THE ROUTE THIS WAVE ADDS, and it is one:

    POST /admin/patients/{patient_id}/logins        enrol_patient_login

Its pair-mate has been mounted since w152 and is re-proved here END TO END
rather than at the domain layer, because the requirement is about sessions
and w152 proved it about a `DataAccess` call:

    POST /admin/patient-logins/{id}/disabled        set_patient_login_disabled

─── THE AUTHORISATION TENSION, RECORDED AND NOT REINTERPRETED ───

w152 STOPPED patient credential issuance and carded it, because
`GEPER_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_SPEC.md` §16 recommends "no patient access in v1"
and wiring the only method that can mint a portal credential would have
settled that product ruling BY IMPLEMENTATION. That was right. It is
superseded by the human's Wave 5 dispatch, which instructs the wiring in
terms and sets the eight requirements below — a ruling that was MADE, by the
person entitled to make it, rather than one an implementer inferred.

§16 still says what it says, and the EXPERT call-out about counselling
provision that accompanies it is still unanswered. Seven `/portal/` routes
and now one issuing route are mounted against it. That is recorded here and
in `clinical/admin_endpoints.py`'s module docstring, and it is not
reinterpreted further in either direction; resolving it is an edit to §16 by
whoever owns §16.

─── WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE ───

IT DOES NOT PROVE THE ROUTE IS REACHABLE BY A REAL DEPLOYMENT, and two
separate things stop it, one inherited and one this wave's own:

  1. Every route on this surface needs an Administrator session, and
     `provision_organisation` — the bootstrap w153 built — has no production
     caller outside `data_access.py`. Every administrative route is exactly
     as reachable as an operator invoking that method directly. This wave's
     route does not change that in either direction.
  2. The route NAMES a `patient_id`, and no route on THIS surface can create
     one. When w155 ran, `create_patient` was STOPPED and carded, so an
     Administrator enrolling a patient had to be handed a patient record some
     other path made — and there was no such path. THAT HALF CHANGED AT w162:
     the human ruled that the ordering clinician owns registration, and
     `POST /clinic/patients` now creates one. It is still not a route on this
     surface and it still does not need an Administrator; what it means is
     that the patient an Administrator enrols can now be produced by a
     production path rather than only by a fixture. See
     `TestTheUngatedThreeAreStoppedAndNotWired` below, which was inverted
     rather than deleted, and
     `clinical/tests/test_w162_registration_and_consent.py`.

So: IMPLEMENTED + TESTED + NOT REACHABLE, in the report's own vocabulary.
The Administrator below is provisioned by INSERTING THE ROLE ROW DIRECTLY,
exactly as `test_identity.py::admin_session`, `test_w133_staff_revocation.py`
and `test_w152_admin_surface.py` already do. That is a FIXTURE, not a
bootstrap.

─── THE FIVE MEASURED HAZARDS THIS FILE IS SHAPED AROUND ───

1. `@auditable` CARRIES NO `functools.wraps`, so `inspect.signature()` on any
   decorated method returns `(self, *args, **kwargs)` and tells you nothing.
   Every structural claim here is read from the SYNTAX TREE, and each one has
   a NON-VACUITY TWIN. `TestTheGateRunsFirst` also demonstrates the wildcard
   itself, so that a future reader who reaches for `inspect` sees why not.
2. A REFUSAL ASSERTING ONLY "IT FAILED" IS GREEN AGAINST BROKEN CODE. Every
   refusal row asserts the exact (status, raw body) pair, and every one has a
   POSITIVE TWIN the broken state fails.
3. THE CROSS-ORGANISATION COLLISION IS CONSTRUCTED, never hoped for. Two
   random UUIDs never collide, so organisation B holds a REAL patient whose
   REAL id organisation A names, and B is read back afterwards and proved to
   have gained no credential.
4. REFUSAL ORDER LEAKS, so refusals are asserted as SETS OF SIZE ONE across
   every case in a class, in BOTH channels at once (Standing Rule 8) — never
   pairwise.
5. VALIDATION ORDER LEAKS TOO. A vocabulary or format check placed before the
   role gate answers to everyone. `TestTheGateRunsFirst` proves the gate is
   the domain method's first statement AND that a caller with the wrong role
   gets the identical 403 whatever it puts in the body.

─── THE WRONG-FIRST LIST, AND WHICH ROW CATCHES EACH ───

(A) ENROLMENT REACHABLE WITHOUT AN ADMINISTRATOR.
    Caught by `TestAdministratorOnlyEnrolment` — an authenticated Orderer and
    an authenticated Auditor, both holding real live sessions in the right
    organisation, are refused, and the credential is then proved not to
    exist. Paired with the positive twin: the Administrator succeeds and the
    issued credential really authenticates at `/portal/login`.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a route with no authentication at all — that is
    `TestAdministratorOnlyEnrolment::test_an_unauthenticated_caller_is_refused`.

(B) THE PATIENT IDENTIFIER TAKEN FROM THE REQUEST AS AUTHORITY ON A PORTAL
    SURFACE.
    Caught by `TestThePatientIdentifierIsNeverAnAuthorityClaim` — every
    `/portal/` handler is read from the syntax tree and proved to take no
    patient identifier in any channel, with a twin that finds one when it
    exists; and behaviourally, the administrative route's identifier is
    proved to select only within the caller's own tenant.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: an administrative route naming a patient, which is
    LEGITIMATE and is the other shape — `TestCrossOrganisationEnrolmentIsRefused`
    is what constrains that one.

(C) CROSS-ORGANISATION ENROLMENT SUCCEEDING.
    Caught by `TestCrossOrganisationEnrolmentIsRefused`, on the constructed
    collision, with organisation B read back.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a leak in the refusal text rather than in the write —
    `TestTheRefusalsCarryNoOracle` is that row.

(D) THE CREDENTIAL ISSUER NOT RECORDED, OR RECORDED AS THE PATIENT.
    Caught by `TestTheCredentialIssuerIsRecorded`: `enrolled_by` is asserted
    EQUAL to the acting Administrator and explicitly UNEQUAL to the patient,
    to the enrolled credential, and to the other organisation's
    Administrator. An equality alone is satisfied by a column that happens to
    hold the right value for the wrong reason; the inequalities are what make
    "recorded as the patient" a failure.

(E) REVOCATION THAT MARKS THE CREDENTIAL BUT LEAVES A LIVE SESSION WORKING.
    Caught by `TestRevocationInvalidatesLivePatientSessions`, with a LIVE
    PATIENT COOKIE obtained from `/portal/login` that fetches `/portal/me`
    successfully BEFORE the revocation and is refused with the identical
    anonymous refusal AFTER it. Without the "before" half the row is
    satisfied by a cookie that never worked.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: the residue w133 documented — a `disabled` flag written
    by some OTHER path, which this route is not. That is
    `test_w133d_writer_guard.py`'s subject and it is unchanged.

(F) A ROUTE THAT LETS A PATIENT ENROL THEMSELVES.
    Caught by `TestNoPublicPatientSelfRegistration`: the served surface is
    enumerated (Standing Rule 9's walker, not `@router.` decorators and not a
    naive `app.routes`), every route that can reach `enrol_patient_login` is
    proved to carry the STAFF session dependency, the production caller
    census of `enrol_patient_login` is taken by syntax tree and is exactly
    one, and a live PATIENT session id presented to the enrolment route is
    refused.
    VACUOUS AGAINST: a staff principal with the wrong role — that is (A).

class TestRevocationInvalidatesLivePatientSessions:
    """
    THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDED THIS CLASS, taken at 60c48d9 before anything
    was built.

    `patient_session_valid` reads ONE `patient_sessions` row by session id and
    checks `terminated_at`, `expires_at` and the idle window. It does NOT join
    `patient_logins` and does NOT read `disabled`. So PATIENT SESSION
    VALIDATION DOES NOT CONSULT THE CREDENTIAL'S DISABLED STATE.

    That makes this the w133 `users.disabled` case and NOT the w154 role case.
    Roles resolve per request, so revoking one needs no session surgery;
    `disabled` is read by nothing on the authenticated path, so writing it
    invalidates nothing by itself and the termination must live in the domain
    method's body. It already does, since w133. NO SECOND MECHANISM WAS ADDED
    — a second one could only disagree with the first.

    What was missing was the PROOF the requirement actually asks for: the

    """
    THE STOP w155 RECORDED HERE WAS LIFTED BY A RULING AT w162, AND THESE ROWS
    NOW PIN THE ANSWER INSTEAD OF THE QUESTION.

    What w155 measured at 60c48d9 was correct and is on the record: all three
    of `create_patient`, `record_consent` and `withdraw_consent` took a
    `Session` and bound `org_id` from it, none contained `_require_role`, and
    none had a production caller — so the gate would break no production
    caller, and WHICH ROLE it should demand was a product decision nobody had
    made. w155 refused to guess, which was the right call.

    The human ruled on 2026-09-19: "PATIENT REGISTRATION + CONSENT — the
    ORDERER/CLINICIAN owns both. Do NOT make Administrator registration
    mandatory. Do NOT make Lab Technician a patient identity creator." That
    ruling is exactly what this stop was waiting on. w162 implemented it —
    `_require_role(session, "Orderer")` as each method's first executable
    statement — and wired the three through `clinical/clinic_endpoints.py`.

    THE ROWS ARE INVERTED RATHER THAN DELETED, because the property w155 cared
    about is still worth pinning: it cared that no gate was invented WITHOUT a
    ruling and no route added WITHOUT one. The full behavioural suite for the
