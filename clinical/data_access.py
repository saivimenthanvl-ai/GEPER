    Clinical platform, Phase 1: the identity data-access layer.

    HOW ORGANISATION ISOLATION IS ENFORCED, stated exactly, because the honest
    version is narrower than "the type system prevents it":

    Python has no compile-time check. What this module provides instead is
    enforcement BY CONSTRUCTION:

    1. Every method that reads or writes org-scoped data takes a `Session` as
        its first argument, and the organisation comes from that session --
        never from a caller-supplied parameter. There is no signature into which
        a caller can pass an organisation of their choosing.
    2. Every SQL statement against an org-scoped table carries `org_id = %s`
        bound from the session. Not one is optional.
    3. There is NO raw-query path. The connection is private, no method returns
        it, and no method accepts SQL. A caller who wants a query that skips the
        org predicate has to edit this file.
    4. `tests/test_identity.py::TestStructuralIsolation` fails if one is
        introduced -- it parses this module and asserts that every SELECT/UPDATE
        touching an org-scoped table mentions org_id, and that no public method
        exposes the connection.

    The schema carries the other half: composite foreign keys on
    (user_id, org_id) mean a role assignment, session, or backup code cannot
    reference a user in another organisation even if this layer were wrong. See
    schema.sql.

    CLOCK INJECTION. Nothing in this module calls `datetime.now()`. Every time
    value comes from `self._clock.now()`. This is not a testing convenience: a
    lockout test that advances a mock clock while production code reads the wall
    clock compares two different clocks and then passes or fails for reasons
    unrelated to the behaviour under test. One clock, injected, all the way
    through.

    # -- the CHECK constraint on `role_assignments.role` enumerates all seven and
    # it is unchanged -- but "System" is not a role anybody holds, it is the
    # INTERNAL SYSTEM PRINCIPAL, and the difference was enforced by convention
    # only.
    #
    # THE CONVENTION, WHICH ALREADY EXISTED EVERYWHERE ELSE:
    #   * `login()` refuses any account with `is_system_account = true`
    #     (reason="system_account"), so the system principal cannot authenticate
    #     interactively;
    #   * the ONLY writer of a `role_assignments` row naming "System" is
    #     `_create_system_session`, which writes it with raw SQL alongside the
    #     `is_system_account = true` user it just created, and whose four call
    #     sites are pinned by name in test_identity.py.
    #
    # THE HOLE THOSE TWO LEFT. `_require_role(session, "System")` reads
    # `role_assignments`; it does NOT read `is_system_account`. So an
    # Administrator calling `assign_role(session, <an ordinary human>, "System")`
    # granted that human the principal the fastq detection write path gates on
    # -- and, because the human's own account is not a system account, that human
    # could still log in interactively and use it. No tenant boundary is crossed
    # (`session.org_id` binds the INSERT and the composite FK enforces it), so
    # this is a privilege-separation defect inside one organisation, not a leak.

    # here and not in a document that ships separately from the code.
    #
    # COUNTED at 0b4bcac over non-test Python, whole tree, quoted-literal match:
    # the workflow declares NINETEEN state values across its four state columns
    # (orders.state 7, samples.qc_status 3, fastq_sets.state 4, reports.state 5).
    # TWELVE have a writer. SEVEN have none: in_progress, reported and closed on
    # orders; returned on reports; validated, rejected and consumed on fastq_sets.
    # Of those seven, exactly TWO occur at all -- `reported` and `closed`, both on
    # ONE line, data_access.py's `cancel_order` guard, and both as a READ
    # predicate. A surface built on a value nothing writes reports the same thing
    # for ever, so none of the seven appears below.
    #
    # AND A WRITER IS NOT ENOUGH. A value written and superseded inside ONE
    # transaction is never seen by any reader, so it is not a state this platform
    # can be observed in. `record_pipeline_result` inserts the sequencing run, the
    # VCF, the interpretation AND the draft report in a single transaction --
    # deliberately, so a failure cannot leave a lineage the platform never reported
    # on. That makes "processing in progress" and "interpretation in progress"
    # unobservable, and it is why the six stages below are six and not seven:
    # Processing and Interpretation are ONE stage, `analysis`, because they are one
    # commit. Splitting them would state twice what is observed once.
    #
    # WHAT EACH REFUSAL COSTS, so nobody "completes" the picture later:
    #   order.not_started      -- a listed order has a row; there is no prior state
    #   sample.in_progress     -- receive_sample writes collected_at AND
    #                             received_at in the same INSERT; nothing records
    #                             "collection requested"
    #   analysis.in_progress   -- the four-row single transaction above
    #   review.<returned>      -- zero writers, zero readers
    #   report.in_progress     -- release is one method: the release_events INSERT
    #                             and the state UPDATE. Nothing marks it pending
    #   a `processing` stage   -- sequencing_runs has no state column and no
    #                             completed_at, so a row cannot say "under way";

    #                             INSERT on that table and no UPDATE at all

    #      secrets manager, a CI secret, an interactive shell) is a deployment
    #      decision this file deliberately does not make."
    #
    # Four further things in the tree say the same:
    #
    #   * `CLINICAL_DSN` (clinical/endpoints.py, clinical/app.py) already arrives
    #     this way and CARRIES THE DATABASE PASSWORD -- app.py's own comment says
    #     so. The environment is already the channel by which this service is given
    #     the credential that grants full read and write on the very table
    #     `totp_secret` lives in. A key delivered the same way is not weaker than
    #     what is already there; a key delivered any other way would be a second
    #     secret channel for a system that has one.
    #   * `GEPER_API_KEYS` (geper/api/main.py::_load_api_keys) is this repository's
    #     production-credential pattern -- read from the environment, refuse on a
    #     malformed value -- and spec section 23.3 records it as IMPLEMENTED. It is
    #     the spec's ONLY statement about how a service credential is supplied.
    #   * `.env.example` is committed, `.env` is gitignored, and docker-compose
    #     passes these through. The deployment channel exists and is documented.
    #   * `clinical/schema.sql`'s comment on `users.totp_secret` already ruled the
    #     shape: "encrypted at rest by the application before it ever reaches this
    #     column ... Encrypted rather than hashed". Application-side symmetric
    #     encryption was decided by the schema, not by this wave. The `SecretCipher`
    #     Protocol above agrees: it is handed no user, no record and no
    #     organisation, which admits exactly one architecture -- a single
    #     process-wide symmetric key from configuration.

        """
        Decorator that wraps a DataAccess method to capture audit outcomes.

        action: str, dict, or callable that resolves to action name.
            - str: single action name used for all outcomes.
            - dict: maps outcome ('success', 'denied', 'error') to action name.
                Enables methods like login() that have different actions per outcome.
            - callable(params, result): returns action name based on parameters/result.
                Enables methods like set_user_disabled() where action depends on parameter.

        resource_type: the resource type being acted upon.

        requires_session: whether the method takes a Session as first argument.

        auditable: whether this method should be audited.
            False: marks this as a deliberate read/non-auditable operation.

        details_builder: callable(bound_params, result) returning audit details dict.
            bound_params: dict of resolved method parameters (positional/keyword resolved).
            result: return value of the method (None on failure).

        reason: explanation for non-auditable methods or special cases.

        resource_id_param: name of the method PARAMETER that identifies the resource
            this entry is about. Default None keeps the original behaviour -- the
            audit row's resource_id comes from the method's RETURN VALUE, which is
            right for the creators (create_report returns the report id) and only
            for them.

            THE DEFECT THIS PARAMETER EXISTS FOR (w120). A method declared `-> None`
            returns no identifier ever, so `str(result) if result else "<none>"`
            recorded '<none>' every time. _approve_report is one of those, and its
            entry -- action='report_approved', resource_type='report' -- therefore
            said a report had been approved without saying WHICH, for the single
            event that makes a report releasable (spec 13.3). `-> bool`
            verify_report_integrity was wrong in the direction that matters most: a
            MATCH recorded the string 'True', and a MISMATCH -- the nonconformance
            ISO 15189 7.5 wants findable -- recorded '<none>', because False is
            falsy.

            A method that cannot return an identifier must therefore say where its
            identifier comes from. Enforced structurally by
            clinical/tests/test_w120_audit_resource_id.py, whose
            test_every_auditable_method_that_cannot_return_an_id_declares_where_its_id_comes_from
            fails any auditable `-> None`/`-> bool` method that neither declares
            this nor appears on that test's reasoned exemption list.

            SUCCESS PATH ONLY. Denied and errored outcomes keep their existing
            '<denied>'/'<error>' markers: what those rows should record is a
            separate question, and widening it here would be a redesign rather
            than a correction.

            THE ONLY PLACE A SECOND FACTOR IS ACCEPTED, AND IT NEVER RETURNS True

            Read the exits rather than the flow: there are exactly two `return
            True` statements reachable from here -- one after a step that has not
            been spent, one inside `_consume_backup_code` after a row was marked
            used in the same statement that matched it. Every other path returns
            False or raises, INCLUDING every exception the crypto can produce.

            ONE-TIME USE (RFC 6238 section 5.2). `matching_step` names the step the
            code belongs to; `users.totp_last_used_step` remembers the last one
            accepted; a step at or before it is refused. Storing the STEP and not
            the CODE is what makes the guard monotonic -- remembering only the last
            code would still admit the PREVIOUS step's code, which the one-step
            skew window keeps arithmetically valid for another half minute.

            FAIL CLOSED, IN TWO DIFFERENT SHAPES, DELIBERATELY:

            * A MISSING COLLABORATOR RAISES. `ConfigurationError` is an operator
                fault -- the account has a secret and this process was given no key
                -- and it must be loud. It is not a login refusal dressed up as one,
                and it never admits: the caller (`clinical/auth_endpoints.py::
                _refuse_uniformly`) flattens it into the same 401 every other
                failure produces, so the loudness reaches the audit trail and the
                operator without reaching the caller.
            * A FAILING COLLABORATOR REFUSES. A secret that will not decrypt (a
                lost key, a rotated-away key, a tampered column) or a verifier that
                raises is a fault about ONE ROW, not about the process. The broad
                `except` below is the point rather than a lapse: whatever it
                catches, `step` stays None and the only paths left are the backup
                code -- which is exactly the recovery route a lost key needs -- and
                refusal. There is no arrangement of an exception here that can

            IT TAKES NO TARGET IDENTIFIER, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. The
            obvious version of this method accepts a `target_session_id` and ends
            it, scoped to the caller's organisation — and that hands every
            authenticated user the capability `terminate_session` reserves for an
            Administrator, through a route called "logout". The defence is not a
            check that the target belongs to the caller: a check can be forgotten,
            refactored away, or made optional by a later `if target_session_id is
            None` convenience. THERE IS NOTHING TO CHECK, because the id ended is
            read from the session object the dependency produced and there is no
            other way to name one.

            NO ROLE IS REQUIRED, and that distinguishes it from
            `terminate_session` above rather than duplicating it. Ending somebody
            else's session is an administrative act; ending your own is not, and
            a self-logout gated on Administrator would mean ordinary staff could
            not log out at all — a defect that would read like security.

            `terminated_by` holds the acting user. `terminated_at IS NULL` in the
            predicate makes a second call a no-op rather than a rewrite: the
            recorded moment a session ended must be the first one, not the last
            redundant request.

            RETURNS THE SESSION ID so that @auditable's `resource_id` names the
            session that ended. A `-> None` here would record `<none>` — the w120
            defect — and an audit row that cannot name its subject is not an
            audit.

            NOT A CREDENTIAL REVOCATION. This ends one session. The credential
            that minted it is untouched and can mint another immediately, which is
            correct for logout and is NOT what `users.disabled` /

            org_id -- and carries no role. `session_valid` reads one `sessions`
            row and returns those three fields; it does not join
            `role_assignments` and never has. `_require_role` calls
            `get_user_roles`, which reads `role_assignments` with
            `revoked_at IS NULL`, on EVERY gated call. Nothing captures a role at
            login, so there is no stale copy anywhere to invalidate.

            Therefore setting `revoked_at` IS the enforcement: the caller's very
            next gated request recomputes the set and fails. Terminating the
            target's sessions here would be a SECOND mechanism for an effect the
            first one already has, and the two could then disagree -- which is
            precisely the failure `set_user_disabled` has to live with and this
            method does not.

            AND THAT IS NOT WHAT `set_user_disabled` DOES, FOR A REASON.
            `users.disabled` is the mirror image: NOTHING on the authenticated
            path reads it. `session_valid` reads only `sessions`, so a disabled
            user's live session stayed valid until its own window closed -- which
            is why w133 had to end the sessions inside that method's body. The
            house pattern is "write the state, then close whatever enforcement
            does not reach"; here enforcement reaches everything, so there is
            nothing to close. Copying the session UPDATE across would not be
            following the pattern, it would be inverting it.

            ── THE UNIT OF REVOCATION IS (USER, ROLE), NOT AN ASSIGNMENT ROW ──

            `_require_role` tests membership in a SET of role NAMES, so the thing
            authorisation is a function of is "does this user still hold this
            role", not "is this particular assignment row live". Revoking one row
            by `assignment_id` would leave a duplicate grant standing and mark a
            row while changing nothing an authorisation check can see -- a writer
            whose effect on authorisation is not guaranteed. This method revokes
            EVERY live assignment of that role for that user in that
            organisation, in one statement, so the post-condition is the one the
            gate actually reads.

            ── REFUSALS, IN THE ORDER `assign_role` ALREADY ESTABLISHED ──

            The Administrator check is FIRST, before the vocabulary check and
            before any row is read, so a caller who is not an Administrator
            learns nothing about which roles exist or which users do.

            "System" IS NOT REVOCABLE HERE, on the same `HUMAN_ASSIGNABLE_ROLES`
            tuple `assign_role` refuses it on (w141) and deliberately not on a
            second, differently-derived rule. That tuple names the roles that are
            part of the HUMAN role lifecycle; "System" is the internal principal
            that `_create_system_session` is the only thing entitled to hold, and
            an Administrator able to withdraw it would hold new authority over
            the internal principal rather than the preserved authority w141 left
            them. The lifecycle is closed at both ends by one constant. This is
            fail-closed: if the platform later needs a System revoker it is an
            addition, not a repair.

            NO SELF-TARGETING RULE IS ADDED, and the absence is preserved on
            purpose. There is no such rule anywhere in this class today --
            `set_user_disabled` lets an Administrator disable their own account
            and says so, and nothing guards a "last Administrator". An
            Administrator who revokes their own Administrator role therefore
            succeeds and is refused on their next administrative request, because
            roles are resolved per request. Whether an organisation should be
            prevented from locking itself out is a product decision nobody has
            made; inventing one here would be widening an existing rule under
            cover of preserving it.

            A USER WHO DOES NOT HOLD THE ROLE IS NOT A REFUSAL. The target
            existing is checked (`get_user`, which is where the 404 and the
            organisation predicate live); holding the role is not. Revoking a
            role nobody holds returns 0 and writes nothing, because the
            post-condition asked for -- "this user does not hold this role" -- is
            already true. Returning the count rather than None is what makes that
            distinction visible to a caller and to the audit row.

            ONE STATEMENT WITH `RETURNING`, not a read followed by a write. The
            count and the change then come from the same statement, so a
            concurrent revoker cannot make this method report a number that does
            not match what it did.

        # WHY IT IS NEEDED, COUNTED AT fd9d63b RATHER THAN ASSERTED. `INSERT INTO
        # role_assignments` occurs at exactly TWO production sites in this
        # repository -- one inside `assign_role`, which requires an existing
        # Administrator, and one inside `_create_system_session`, which only ever
        # writes 'System' and which w141 made unassignable to a person. So a fresh
        # deployment could not produce its first Administrator by any code path,
        # and the four administrative routes `clinical/admin_endpoints.py` mounted
        # were correct, tested and unreachable because of it.
        #
        # `clinical/bootstrap.py` IS NOT THIS AND NEVER WAS. Read rather than
        # inferred from its name, it creates the two POSTGRES LOGIN ROLES that
        # `schema.sql` grants to and optionally applies the schema. It writes no
        # application row of any kind. It is a DATABASE bootstrap; this is an
        # IDENTITY one, and they are not substitutes.
        #
        # THE THREE WRITES ARE DELIBERATELY OPEN-CODED, and this is the single
        # most important thing about the method. Composing it out of the existing
        # `create_organisation` and `create_user` would be the obvious
        # implementation and it would be silently WRONG: `@auditable` calls
        # `commit()` ITSELF after writing each audit row, OUTSIDE `@transactional`'s
        # `_in_transaction` re-entrancy guard, so each inner call would commit
        # mid-way. A failure at the role step would then leave a committed
        # organisation and a committed user with NO ADMINISTRATOR -- the exact
        # unusable state this method exists to prevent.
        #
        # THE TRANSACTION BOUNDARY is `@transactional` on this method. `@auditable`
        # is the OUTER decorator, so on an unexpected exception `@transactional`
        # has already ROLLED BACK before `@auditable`'s error branch writes and
        # commits its row: the data goes, the evidence stays.
        #
        # WHAT MAKES IT INERT ONCE AN ADMINISTRATOR EXISTS -- and it is not a
        # flag, because a flag is something a caller supplies:
        #   * `org_id` is generated HERE, by `uuid.uuid4()`. There is no parameter
        #     of any kind by which a caller could name an existing organisation,
        #     so this method can never add an Administrator to a tenant that
        #     already has one. The wrong version is UNWRITABLE, not merely
        #     refused -- the same defence-by-absent-parameter shape as
        #     `terminate_my_session` and `list_my_report_trend`.
        #   * the role is a SQL LITERAL, not a parameter, so 'System' cannot be
        #     reached through it either.
        #   * it is on no served surface, and the only caller is an operator who
        #     already holds the database credential and could therefore already
        #     write these three rows by hand. It grants nobody a capability they
        #     did not already have; it makes an out-of-band raw INSERT into one
        #     audited atomic act.
        # A SECOND CALL IS NOT REFUSED. It creates a SECOND organisation with that
        # organisation's own first Administrator, which is spec 4.2's
        # single-instance multi-organisation tenancy, not a bypass.
        #
        # THE ACTOR IS NULL AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. There is no session, so
        # the audit row's `user_id` and `actor_role` are NULL: the creator is an
        # operator outside the tenancy model and no principal exists to name. An

            ADMINISTRATOR ONLY, and deliberately not self-service. These are the
            credentials a report prints as evidence of who stands behind it; a
            clinician who could edit their own would make the printed credential
            self-asserted, which is the property the ruling exists to remove. The

            identity had been recorded.

            Corrections are supported (this is an UPDATE, not an insert-once), and

            a corrected registration number corrects what an already-approved

            AND IT ENDS THE USER'S LIVE SESSIONS (w133). Until w133 this method
            wrote one row in `users` and nothing else, and that was a real gap
            rather than a tidy omission: `session_valid` reads only `sessions` and
            `_require_role` reads only `role_assignments`, so NOTHING anywhere
            consulted `users.disabled` once a session existed. A user disabled at
            10:00 passed validation at 10:01 and kept every Administrator-gated
            capability -- including disabling somebody else -- for up to the 24h
            absolute cap, with the 30-minute idle window refreshed by their own
            activity. Measured, not reasoned: the two capability rows in
            test_w133_staff_revocation.py failed with "DID NOT RAISE" against the
            previous version of this method.

            The statement is in THIS body, not a second decorated call, because
            @auditable commits after every audit row it writes: a composition
            would commit "user_disabled" while the sessions ran on, and an audit
            that records something that did not happen is worse than one that
            records nothing.

            `terminated_by` holds the ACTING Administrator, consistent with
            terminate_session. `terminated_at IS NULL` makes a second disable a
            no-op rather than a rewrite. ONLY WHEN `disabled` IS TRUTHY: re-enabling
            must not terminate anything, and it does not resurrect anything either.

            POINT-IN-TIME, NOT CONTINUOUS, AND THE RESIDUE IS REAL. This ends the
            sessions that exist WHEN IT RUNS. `session_valid` is unchanged -- one
            row from `sessions` by primary key, no join on `users` -- so a
            `disabled` flag set by any other route (direct SQL, a restore, a
            future bootstrap) leaves that user's live sessions valid until their
            own window closes. Closing that residue means reading the principal
            row on every authenticated request, which is a change to the hottest
            path in this layer and was deliberately not made here. Proved, not
            described, by test_w133_staff_revocation.py::TestTheResidueIsReal.

            WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it does not touch role resolution. `_require_role`
            still reads `role_assignments` and still never consults this flag. The
            capability is removed by the session ending, which is what
            `_get_session` revalidates on every request -- not by the roles
            changing. That distinction is why the staff tests make a real
            role-gated call through the request path rather than asserting on
            validation alone.

            Create a patient record in this organisation.

            REQUIRES THE ORDERER ROLE (w162, human ruling 2026-09-19: "PATIENT
            REGISTRATION + CONSENT -- the ORDERER/CLINICIAN owns both. Do NOT make
            Administrator registration mandatory. Do NOT make Lab Technician a
            patient identity creator.").

            THE TOKEN IS READ OFF THE VOCABULARY, NOT CHOSEN. `ROLES` is what the
            schema's CHECK on `role_assignments.role` enumerates, and exactly one
            of its seven names a clinician -- the same one `create_order` already
            names for the same reason ("Ordering a test is the clinical decision
            the Orderer role names"). Registration and consent are the acts that
            precede an order and they belong to the principal who places it.

            NO HIERARCHY IS INTRODUCED, which is the half a later reader will be
            tempted to undo. An Administrator is NOT implicitly an Orderer here,
            exactly as `create_order` already says: the ruling gives Administrator
            organisation/staff administration, and a role that silently subsumes
            the others is the RBAC redesign the same ruling forbids. The ruling
            forbids MANDATORY Administrator registration and is silent on whether
            Administrator may ALSO register; the narrower reading is implemented
            and the widening is carded, because widening a gate later is a line
            and a test while narrowing one after deployment withdraws a
            capability somebody is using.

            UNTIL w162 THIS METHOD ENFORCED NO ROLE AT ALL. Every authenticated
            session in the organisation could mint a patient identity, and w155
            correctly refused to guess a role without a ruling. The ruling is now
            in force and this is it.

            `dob` ACCEPTS A `date` OR AN ISO-8601 STRING, AND THE PARSE IS BELOW
            THE GATE. That is not a convenience: `clinical/clinic_endpoints.py`
            takes the date as a `str` because Pydantic runs BEFORE the handler and
            therefore before this gate, so a `datetime.date` annotation on the
            request model would answer "that is not a date" to a caller whose
            authorisation had not been evaluated. The format check belongs where
            the `sex` vocabulary already is -- after the gate -- so it lives here.
            Existing callers passing a `date` are unaffected.

            THE ORDER MATTERS AND IS PINNED BY A TEST: the role gate is the FIRST
            EXECUTABLE STATEMENT, above the format parse and above the sex
            vocabulary, so an unauthorised caller's refusal cannot vary with the
            content of the body.

            THE GATE IS THE FIRST EXECUTABLE STATEMENT, above the patient lookup,

            evidence, and a claimed actor is indistinguishable in the log from a

            consulted it: `Orderer` occurred exactly once in all non-test Python
            of clinical/ and geper/, inside the ROLES tuple, so every
            authenticated session in the organisation could order equally.

            diagram instead of off the code". That reasoning was correct while it
            stood and it is no longer the state of the tree: the human ruled on
            2026-09-19 that the ordering clinician owns registration and consent,
            and all three are now `_require_role(session, "Orderer")` as their

            definition, not by grepping for a word -- and it is the inverse of

            WHAT THIS IS NOT: a deletion. The row stays and `withdrawn_at` /
            `withdrawn_by` are stamped on it, so the consent remains readable as
            the historical fact it is. The `withdrawn_at IS NULL` predicate below

            ones, and a distinct status would tell a caller that a consent it may

            placed against this consent -- IS NOT DECIDED HERE AND IS NOT DECIDED

            no writer". `sample_awaited` is written by `receive_sample` AFTER the
            specimen has arrived (see that method), so the column's own vocabulary
            is inverted: a patient whose sample is already sequenced would be shown
            "awaiting sample". The column is not renderable to a patient under any
            name, and no caller of this method is given the chance to try.

            WHAT IS RETURNED INSTEAD (w134): `stages`, DERIVED. Six named stages,
            each carrying one value out of a vocabulary that this repository's
            WRITERS support -- see `derive_order_stages`, which is where every
            refusal is justified value by value. Nothing here is stored; there is
            no status column, no status table and no transition. Delete
            `derive_order_stages` and the workflow is exactly what it was.

            THE COUNTS THE DERIVATION NEEDS ARE AGGREGATED IN THE DATABASE, in two
            lateral subqueries, each of which is an ungrouped aggregate and so
            returns exactly one row. That is not a micro-optimisation: a plain
            LEFT JOIN to `samples` and to `reports` would FAN OUT, and an order
            with two samples would appear twice in a patient's list of orders.

            EVERY SUBQUERY IS ORG-SCOPED ON ITS OWN, correlated to `o.org_id`
            rather than trusting the outer join to have narrowed it. The chain
            samples -> sequencing_runs -> vcfs -> interpretations -> reports is
            followed with the composite (org_id, id) keys the schema declares, so
            no hop can cross an organisation even if a bare id were duplicated.

        # ── w135: the patient's own RELEASED reports ─────────────────────────────
        #
        # WHAT A RELEASED REPORT CONSISTS OF IN THIS MODEL, STATED AS A
        # MEASUREMENT BEFORE ANYTHING IS RETURNED. `reports` carries org_id, id,
        # interpretation_id, created_at, created_by, state, approver_id,
        # approved_at, content_hash, tombstoned_at, tombstoned_by and
        # retention_days -- and NO CONTENT COLUMN. A `reports` row is a governance
        # record ABOUT a document, not the document. The document itself is
        # rendered outside this schema, from `interpretations.run_document`, by
        # geper/report/clinical_report_builder.py, and is not stored here in any
        # form.
        #
        # SO THE TWO METHODS BELOW RETURN METADATA AND RELEASE STATE, AND THAT IS
        # THE WHOLE OF WHAT THERE IS TO RETURN. This is not a reduced version of a
        # richer surface: there is no richer surface in this schema, and inventing
        # report-content storage to make one is the thing the brief forbids.
        #
        # WHY `run_document` IS NOT THE SUBSTITUTE, and this is the one edge a
        # future implementer will be tempted by. `get_interpretation` returns the
        # entire raw run_document with NO report-state check at all -- so routing a
        # patient through it would hand out the unapproved pipeline output of a
        # DRAFT report, which is precisely the "raw result data must not bypass
        # report-release rules" failure. Neither method below reads
        # `interpretations`, `vcfs`, `variants` or `run_document`, and neither
        # returns `interpretation_id`: an interpretation id is the handle that
        # addresses raw pipeline output, and handing it to a patient makes the
        # bypass one route away instead of zero.
        #
        # THE RELEASE REQUIREMENT, AND WHY `require_release` IS NOT CALLED HERE.
        # `require_release` is the gate every STAFF delivery path calls, and since
        # w129 phase B it is an AUTHORITY gate as well as a state gate: its first
        # line is `self._require_role(session, "Approver")`. A patient never holds
        # Approver and never will, so calling it from a patient read would either
        # refuse every patient or require weakening the gate -- and weakening it is
        # forbidden. These methods do not re-implement it either. They read the
        # RECORDED OUTCOME of a release that already happened: a `release_events`
        # row, written by `_release_report` behind that same Approver gate, for a
        # report whose own state says `released`. That is strictly NARROWER than
        # `require_release` admits (it passes `approved` as well), and narrower is
        # the safe direction.
        #
        # NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY CALLS `_release_report`. COUNTED at d6246cd,
        # non-test callers: ZERO (the one grep hit is prose in
        # geper/review/signoff.py). So in THIS deployment no report ever reaches
        # `released` and both methods below return nothing for everybody, for ever.
        # They are still correct, and they are tested by driving `_release_report`
        # itself; what cannot be demonstrated is a production path that reaches
        # them. Recorded here rather than implied.
        #
        # RETRACTION IS FLAGGED HERE AND NEVER FILTERED -- w148, human decision 1.
        # COUNTED, AND THE COUNT HAS MOVED since this note was first written:
        # `report_retractions` DOES now exist in schema.sql (migration 0003,
        # 2de2fef), while `clinical/data_access.py` STILL has no
        # unapprove/retract/rescind method -- re-counted at 2de2fef, and
        # enforce_content_immutability() still FORBIDS walking an approved report
        # back at the database. So the table is readable and nothing in this
        # repository can write to it; see the flag's own note below the readers.
        #
        # The human rulings settle the reader question in the opposite direction
        # from hiding: E7 says a retracted report must NOT become unfindable, and
        # E3 says retraction does not refuse at the release gate -- the retraction
        # TRAVELS with the document instead. Decision 1 is that form exactly: these
        # methods filter on RELEASE, never on retraction, and return
        # `is_retracted` as a plain boolean beside the row. No reason, no
        # retractor, no timestamp, no `replacement_report_id`.

            Every RELEASED report belonging to the authenticated patient. TAKES NO
            PATIENT IDENTIFIER, and takes no identifier of any other kind either.

            ANCHORED ON `patients`, like every other portal read: both predicates
            are bound at the anchor, from the session, and the chain
            orders -> samples -> sequencing_runs -> vcfs -> interpretations ->
            reports is walked with the composite (org_id, id) keys the schema
            declares, so no hop can cross an organisation even if a bare id
            repeated.

            THE RELEASE PREDICATE IS TWO CONDITIONS, NOT ONE, and the second is
            the load-bearing one. `reports.state = 'released'` is, by
            `_release_report`'s own docstring, a DERIVED SUMMARY -- "has this
            report been released at all" -- while `release_events` is the record of
            who received what and when. A surface that trusted the summary alone
            would show a report as delivered on the strength of a column the
            application holds a column-scoped write grant on (schema.sql's
            `GRANT` block, near the bottom, on `reports`). So the delivery record
            is required to exist as well.

            THE LATERAL AGGREGATE IS A CORRECTNESS REQUIREMENT, not a performance
            choice, and it is the same hazard w134 hit one table over: a report
            released to three consumers has THREE `release_events` rows, and a
            plain JOIN would return that patient's one report three times.

            `released_at` IS THE FIRST DELIVERY (`min`), which is also the anchor
            the retention clock uses (ruling D3, clinical/retention.py): re-delivery
            to a second consumer does not restart it and does not change what the
            patient is told about when their report was issued.

            WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT RETURNED, each with its reason:
            * `interpretation_id` -- the handle to raw pipeline output (above).
            * `approver_id` / any approver name -- ISO 15189 7.4.1.5 c) requires
                the authoriser to be RETRIEVABLE, and it is, from `reports`, by a
                staff reader. Naming a member of laboratory staff to a patient over
                an unauthenticated-by-default internet surface is a separate
                ruling nobody has made.
            * `content_hash` -- a SHA-256 of content this surface does not carry.
            * `state` -- every row returned is `released` by construction, so a
                state field could only ever say one thing.
            * `tombstoned_at` -- see the module note above and w135's card.
            * EVERY COLUMN OF `report_retractions` EXCEPT THE FACT ITSELF --
                w148, human decision 1, stated as a refusal because that is what
                it is: `reason`, `retracted_by`, `retracted_at`,
                `retracted_from_state` and `replacement_report_id` are all
                available in the row this statement already touches, and none of
                them is returned. The reason is internal review detail; the
                retractor is a member of laboratory staff (the same ruling that
                withholds `approver_id`); the replacement is E4's optional edge,
                which the human declined for this surface. What IS returned is one
                boolean, `is_retracted`.

            WHAT IS NOW RETURNED, AND IT IS FOUR FIELDS RATHER THAN THREE:

        #
        # WHAT A PATIENT TREND IS IN THIS MODEL, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. The held
        # trends work (`w127-trends`, tip 861e59f, read via `git show`, NEVER
        # MERGED) builds a series of ACMG CLASSIFICATIONS, one point per variant
        # per INTERPRETATION, read out of `interpretations.run_document`. That
        # series is NOT served to a patient here, and there are two separate
        # reasons, either of which alone would be sufficient:
        #
        #   1. IT IS THE REFUSAL w135 ALREADY MADE, ONE WAVE AGO, IN THIS FILE.
        #      `run_document` is raw pipeline output with no report-state check
        #      anywhere near it; `get_interpretation` returns the whole of it. The
        #      two report readers above return no `interpretation_id` precisely so
        #      that the bypass is zero routes away rather than one, and two tests
        #      in test_w135_patient_report_access.py pin that. Reversing that
        #      refusal one wave later, with no ruling, is not a reconciliation.
        #   2. A CLASSIFICATION SERIES CANNOT CARRY A RETRACTION. Retraction, on
        #      the held `w122-retraction` (a4907d3), attaches to a REPORT --
        #      `report_retractions.report_id`. A w127 trend point is keyed on an
        #      INTERPRETATION, and one interpretation carries many reports (an
        #      amendment is a new `reports` row on the SAME interpretation_id; see
        #      create_amendment). So there is no function from a w127 point to a
        #      retraction status: the point names the wrong object. Human ruling
        #      E3's whole bargain is that the retraction TRAVELS WITH THE
        #      DOCUMENT, and a series that structurally cannot carry it has taken
        #      the benefit of that bargain without paying it.
        #
        # SO THE SERIES THIS FILE SERVES A PATIENT IS KEYED ON REPORTS, which is
        # the object retraction, amendment and release all already attach to. The
        # trend a patient can be told about, in THIS model, is: which reports were
        # issued to me, in what order, and which of them replaced which.
        #
        # THE EDGE IS `amendments`, WHICH EXISTS AT THIS SHA -- COUNTED. The
        # corrective act this schema has is AMENDMENT (schema.sql:1213,
        # `clinical_app` holds SELECT at schema.sql:1594, `create_amendment` is
        # Approver-gated).
        #
        # RE-COUNTED IN w148, BECAUSE HALF OF WHAT THIS PARAGRAPH SAID HAS STOPPED
        # BEING TRUE and a census claim gets fixed rather than left standing. It
        # used to read "the one it does not have is RETRACTION (`report_retractions`
        # appears 0 times in schema.sql ...)". At 2de2fef `report_retractions`
        # appears in schema.sql and has its own migration. What has NOT changed is
        # the other half: there is still no retract/unapprove/rescind verb in this
        # class, and enforce_content_immutability still REFUSES to walk an approved
        # report back. So the schema can RECORD a retraction and this layer can
        # READ one; nothing in this repository can CREATE one.
        #
        # AND NOTHING IS FILTERED. No retraction predicate, no tombstone
        # predicate -- only release, exactly as the two readers above. Rulings E3
        # and E7 settle the reader question in the opposite direction from hiding:
        # a retracted report is STILL RETURNED, carrying the fact, because
        # filtering it "would make a retracted report unfindable".
        #
        # w148: THAT IS NO LONGER A FORECAST. `report_retractions` arrived in the
        # schema with migration 0003 (2de2fef), the two rows that said "fail the
        # moment this table appears" did exactly that, and the human ruled both
        # patient surfaces: a SIMPLE BOOLEAN, and nothing else.
        #
        #   1. PATIENT RETRACTED REPORT -- Decision A. The report responses expose
        #      a retraction flag. NOT the reason, NOT the reviewer, NOT
        #      `replacement_report_id`.
        #   2. PATIENT RETRACTED TREND POINT -- Decision A. The point REMAINS in
        #      the series and carries the same flag. Again no replacement id and
        #      no internal detail.
        #
        # SO E4's OPTIONAL `replacement_report_id` IS REFUSED, and its refusal is
        # the whole of the difference between this wave and the forecast above:
        # the edge shape was available and the human declined it.
        #
        # WHERE THE FLAG LIVES, AND WHY IT COULD NOT LIVE ANYWHERE ELSE. It is a
        # SCALAR `EXISTS` IN THE SELECT LIST of this same statement. Two standing
        # requirements forced that and neither had any give in it:
        #   * `test_every_portal_statement_binds_the_patient_from_the_session`
        #     requires every statement a portal method issues to bind the
        #     session's patient, and `test_the_two_methods_share_one_sql_text`
        #     pins the caller count of this constant at exactly four -- one
        #     definition and three callers. A SECOND statement breaks both.
        #   * Rulings E3/E7 forbid the flag from removing a row.
        # A projection satisfies both by construction: it is evaluated per row
        # that the FROM/WHERE has ALREADY chosen, so it cannot add a row and
        # cannot drop one, and it inherits this statement's patient anchor rather
        # than needing its own.
        #
        # AND IT IS BOUND TO THE ROW IT DESCRIBES, on BOTH axes, structurally:
        # `rr.org_id = rep.org_id AND rr.report_id = rep.id`. Without the first, a
        # retraction in another tenant would flag this patient's report; without
        # the second, one patient's retraction would flag their neighbour's. Both
        # wrong versions have their own test.
        #
        # THE TWO GUARD ROWS THAT SAID `"retract" not in shared` WERE RE-AUTHORED,
        # NOT DELETED, and the property they protected is unchanged: retraction
        # must not decide WHICH ROWS COME BACK. They now assert that the word
        # appears ONLY in the select list and NOWHERE in the FROM/JOIN/WHERE --

        # ONE SQL TEXT, THREE CALLERS. The list, the single-report read and the
        # trend must not be able to disagree about what "released" and "mine"

        #
        # WHY THE EDGE CANNOT POINT OUTSIDE THE CALLER'S OWN RELEASED REPORTS,
        # STRUCTURALLY AND NOT BY ARGUMENT:
        #   * `orig.interpretation_id = rep.interpretation_id` -- create_amendment
        #     copies the original's interpretation_id onto the amendment, so an
        #     amendment and its original always share one interpretation, which
        #     already sits under this patient's own order via the five hops above.
        #     An edge to another patient's report cannot satisfy it.
        #   * `orig.state = 'released'` AND an EXISTS over `release_events` -- the
        #     same two conditions, in the same order, that gate the rows
        #     themselves. Naming an original the patient was never sent would be
        #     an existence oracle for an unreleased report id.
        #   * `amd.org_id = rep.org_id` on every hop, as everywhere else here.
        # LATERAL ... LIMIT 1 rather than a plain JOIN: `amendments` has no unique
        # constraint on `amendment_report_id`, and a plain join would return the
        # patient's one report twice if one ever appeared twice. Same hazard the
        # `rel` aggregate exists for, one table over.
        #
        # THE FIFTH COLUMN IS THE RETRACTION FLAG (w148), and it is a SCALAR
        # SUBQUERY IN THE PROJECTION rather than a join for the reason set out at
        # length above: a projection cannot change the row set, which is exactly
        # what rulings E3 and E7 forbid it from doing. It is bound on both axes to

            The authenticated patient's own released reports AS A SERIES, in
            first-delivery order, with the supersession edge between them.

            TAKES NO IDENTIFIER OF ANY KIND -- not a patient id, not a report id,
            not a date range. The patient is bound from the session at the anchor,
            in the ONE shared SQL text above, exactly as the two w135 readers are.

            WHAT A POINT IS: one RELEASED report of the caller's own. Not an
            interpretation, not a variant, not a classification. The node key is a
            `report_id`, which is the object `amendments`, `release_events` and
            (on the held w122 branch) `report_retractions` all attach to.

            `amends_report_id` -- the caller's own released report that THIS one
            was created to correct, or None. `superseded_by_report_id` is its
            inverse, DERIVED IN PYTHON FROM THIS SAME LIST and never from a second
            query: it can therefore only ever name a report already in the answer,
            so it is structurally incapable of being an existence oracle for a
            report the caller cannot see. A second query would not have that
            property for free.

            NOTHING IS HIDDEN. There is no retraction predicate and no tombstone
            predicate; the only thing that keeps a report out of this series is
            that it was never released to anyone. See the long note above the SQL
            for rulings E3/E7 and for why a classification series is refused.

            `is_retracted` -- w148, human decision 2: "a trend point originating
            from a retracted report REMAINS in the patient's longitudinal data but
            carries an `is_retracted` flag." A boolean, per POINT, derived in the
            shared statement's projection and bound there to (org_id, report_id),
            so a retraction belonging to another patient or another organisation
            cannot reach it. NO `replacement_report_id` and no other internal
            retraction detail, which the same decision refuses explicitly -- and
            that refusal is what makes this different from `amends_report_id`
            beside it, whose edge shape E4 would have allowed.

            IN THIS DEPLOYMENT THIS METHOD RETURNS `[]` FOR EVERY PATIENT, FOR
            EVER, because `_release_report` has ZERO non-test callers (re-counted
            at 3a482f1). It is still correct, and the tests construct the released
            state the only legitimate way there is -- by calling `_release_report`
            behind its own Approver gate. What is not claimed is that any
            production path reaches it. Same finding as w134-C3 and w135-C3.

            Issue a portal credential for one patient. STAFF ENROLMENT: a staff
            principal chooses the patient record, and there is no self-registration
            path of any kind.

            That is what answers "how is a person matched to their patient record?"
            -- a staff member who already knows which record this is picks it. It
            is not answered by an external identifier vocabulary, and this method
            deliberately does not consult external_identifiers.

            WHY THIS IS ONE METHOD AND NOT A COMPOSITION. @auditable commits after
            each audit row it writes. So a version assembled out of two decorated
            calls -- "check the patient, then create the credential" -- would leave
            the first call's audit row committed when the second failed, and the
            audit would record an enrolment that did not happen. The precondition
            reads, the uniqueness read and the INSERT are therefore all inside one
            @transactional body with exactly one @auditable around the whole of it.
            A failure anywhere leaves NOTHING: no credential row, and no
            success-outcome audit row.

            THE ROLE. Administrator, on the conservative default the design
            recorded: issuing a credential is account administration, and
            assign_role, enrol_totp and set_user_disabled are all Administrator
            today. Which role SHOULD own patient credential issuance is a ruling
            that has not been made; this picks the tightest existing gate rather
            than inventing an eighth role or leaving the method ungated. Note that
            it is strictly tighter than the surrounding patient lifecycle, where
            create_patient and record_consent are gated by nothing at all -- this
            does not weaken that; it declines to copy it.

            Revoke (or restore) a patient's portal credential, AND END THE LIVE

            Never a DELETE, for the reason set_user_disabled gives: it would orphan
            the audit chain, and nothing in this schema deletes.

            WHY THE SESSION TERMINATION IS IN THIS BODY AND NOT A SECOND CALL.
            @auditable commits after every audit row it writes. A revocation
            assembled out of two decorated calls -- "disable the credential, then
            end its sessions" -- would leave a committed audit row saying the
            credential was revoked while the sessions ran on, which is the worst
            of the three possible outcomes: the record says the thing happened.
            So the role gate, the precondition read, the credential UPDATE and the
            session UPDATE are one @transactional body inside exactly one
            @auditable. A failure anywhere leaves NOTHING: the credential still
            authenticates and no success-outcome row exists. Pinned by
            test_w133_revocation.py::TestAtomicity.

            THE UPDATE IS KEYED ON patient_login_id, AND THAT IS THE STATEMENT
            terminate_my_patient_session DELIBERATELY REFUSED. The two are not in
            conflict; they are opposites and both are deliberate:

                logout      is SELF-SCOPED, takes no target, and ends ONE session.
                            Keying it on the credential would sign a patient out
                            of every device they have, under a button that says
                            "log out".
                revocation  is ADMINISTRATIVE, names a target, and withdraws THE
                            CREDENTIAL. Every session that credential minted was
                            minted by the thing being withdrawn, so ending only
                            one of them would leave the revoked holder logged in
                            on the other device -- which is the actor the
                            revocation was invoked against.

            `terminated_by` HOLDS THE ACTING ADMINISTRATOR'S user_id -- the column
            names the actor and the actor is the Administrator, consistent with
            terminate_session. It is expressible without a schema change only
            because `terminated_by` has NO foreign key on either session table.
            (Which of the two ids an administrative termination SHOULD record is
            an open question, carded; this picks the actor and says so.)

            `terminated_at IS NULL` makes a second revocation a no-op rather than
            a rewrite: the recorded moment a session ended is the first one.

            ONLY WHEN `disabled` IS TRUTHY. Re-enabling must not terminate
            anything -- and it does not resurrect anything either: a session ended
            by a revocation stays ended, and the restored credential must be used
            to obtain a new one.

            POINT-IN-TIME, NOT CONTINUOUS -- AND THE RESIDUE IS REAL. This method
            ends the sessions that exist WHEN IT RUNS. Session validation is
            unchanged: patient_session_valid still reads one row from
            patient_sessions by primary key and never joins patient_logins. So a
            `disabled` flag set by ANY OTHER ROUTE -- direct SQL, a restore, a
            future bootstrap -- leaves that credential's live sessions valid until
            their own idle or absolute window closes. Closing that residue means
            teaching session validation to read the principal row on every
            request, which is a different change to the hottest path in the layer.
            It was not made here. The residue is proved, not merely described, by
            test_w133_revocation.py::TestTheResidueIsReal.

            THE WAY BACK IS NARROW, and a caller should know it before revoking: a
            disabled credential cannot be deleted (nothing deletes), cannot be
            replaced (patient_logins_one_per_patient, and enrol_patient_login
            raises PatientAlreadyEnrolledError), and its password cannot be
            changed (no principal in this repository has a password-change
            method). Re-enabling the same credential, with the same hash, is the
            only route back today.

            Raises NotFoundError carrying PATIENT_NOT_FOUND -- the module
            constant, never an f-string naming the id -- for a credential that
            does not exist IN THIS ORGANISATION, which is byte for byte the
            refusal for one that does not exist anywhere.

            Spec 15.3: "Re-analysis produces a new interpretation, a new report,
            and a new lineage branch from the same VCF. It does not update the
            old one." This creates the new interpretation only; call
            create_report() with the returned id exactly as for a fresh
            interpretation -- the two-call pattern is unchanged, only the source
            of the interpretation differs.

            Human ruling 1 (who may trigger): same act as create_interpretation,
            with a different trigger -- create_interpretation has no explicit
            role gate today, so this does not add one either. Widening either
            method's gating is a separate decision, not this commit's.

            Human ruling 2 (predecessor state): not gated on the parent's report
            state. 15.3 re-interprets the VCF, not the report -- a draft or
            under-review report on the parent must not block new evidence being
            applied to the underlying data. No report-state query appears here.

            Human ruling 3 (branching): parent_interpretation_id is the caller's
            explicit claim, never derived as "the current tip" of anything --
            A->B and A->C are both valid, and so is re-branching from B after C
            exists. The only validation is that the named parent exists, is in
            this org, and belongs to the named vcf_id -- so a caller who passes
            a parent from a different VCF is refused rather than silently
            re-analysing the wrong data.

            submission_key: interpretations.submission_key is UNIQUE per org
            (Phase 4a idempotency for original submissions). Reusing that
            formula (content_hash|platform_sample_id) here would make every
            re-analysis of the same VCF collide with the original AND with each
            other, which directly contradicts ruling 3's "A->B and A->C both
            valid". A re-analysis is a deliberate new act, not a resubmission,
            so it gets a key that is unconditionally unique per call instead of
            idempotent on content.

            WHY THIS DOES NOT CALL create_sequencing_run / create_vcf /
            create_interpretation / create_report. Each of those is @auditable,
            and @auditable commits when it returns. Called in a row they are four
            commits, and a failure at the third or fourth left a VCF with no
            interpretation, or an interpretation with no report, in the record --
            a lineage the platform never produced a report for. So this method
            performs the same inserts (same columns, same org scoping, same
            retention inheritance, same submission-key formula) inside ONE
            @transactional body, writes the same per-resource audit rows WITHOUT
            committing, and commits once. The existing methods are unchanged.

            VCF IDENTITY. `expected_vcf_hash` is the SHA-256 the caller took of
            the VCF BEFORE running the pipeline. It is recomputed here from the
            file on disk; if the two differ the run analysed different bytes from
            the ones about to be recorded against it, and VcfChangedError is
            raised before anything is written.

            DUPLICATES. uk_interp_submission makes a second interpretation of the
            same VCF content for the same sample impossible; that refusal
            surfaces as DuplicateInterpretationError (nothing from this attempt
            written) so a retrying worker can find the first one with
            find_interpretation_by_submission_key instead of failing.

            Refusals before any write: the sample is not in this organisation, or
            its order/patient chain does not resolve (NotFoundError), or the VCF
            changed (VcfChangedError). Any failure after the first write rolls
            every row back; the outer @auditable still records the attempt as an
            error.

            Create or retrieve a session for the system principal of this organisation.

            ⚠️ AUTHENTICATION BYPASS BY DESIGN
            ──────────────────────────────────
            This method creates a session WITHOUT authentication, and the session_id it
            mints is a real row in `sessions` and therefore a valid bearer credential for
            clinical/endpoints.py::_get_session. It MUST NOT be called from any
            request-handling context or endpoint. If it is, that is an authentication
            bypass.

            THE CALL SITES, AND WHY THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO BE FALSE (w129 GAP-5).
            It used to say "an AST test enforces that this method is called from exactly
            one location". Both halves were wrong. The test read only data_access.py and
            matched only `self._create_system_session(`, of which there are none, so it
            asserted 0 <= 1 and had never examined a call site. And the real number is not
            one: there are FOUR, all spelled `self.data_access._create_system_session`,
            all outside this file --

                geper/api/exception_retry_worker.py  ExceptionRetryWorker._process_all_orgs
                geper/api/submission_worker.py       InterpretationWorker._create_submission_failure_exception
                geper/api/submission_worker.py       InterpretationWorker._clinical_preflight
                geper/api/submission_worker.py       InterpretationWorker.reconcile_interrupted_submissions

            THE RULE IS ABOUT WHERE, NOT HOW MANY. Every call site must sit inside a
            background worker class in geper/api/ that runs as its own process, has no
            human actor, and is not reachable from any served route -- counted: neither
            worker class is referenced by geper/api/main.py, clinical/app.py or
            clinical/endpoints.py, and each is instantiated only by its own module's
            main(). The four sites are pinned BY NAME in
            clinical/tests/test_identity.py::TestStructuralIsolation, so a fifth fails
            the suite and so does narrowing the scan back to this file.

            Resolve an exception, recording the resolution event and updating status.

            w129 GAP-1. This method used to have an asymmetry inside its own body:
            the UPDATE bound org_id, the INSERT did not. `_execute` returns None and
            never inspects rowcount, so when the UPDATE matched zero rows -- which is
            exactly what happens when the caller names another organisation's
            exception -- nothing stopped execution falling through into an INSERT
            that appended a 'resolve' row to the victim's append-only history. The
            method RETURNED NORMALLY. Measured, not reasoned.

            Two changes, and they are deliberately both here rather than either one
            alone:

            1. The exception is resolved org-scoped FIRST and a miss raises
                NotFoundError. A zero-row UPDATE must not be a silent success, and
                refusing here is also what makes the endpoint's two refusals
                identical -- a foreign id and an invented id both arrive at this
                same NotFoundError with the same message shape (w129 GAP-2).
            2. The event INSERT binds org_id from the session, and the schema's
                composite foreign key (exception_id, org_id) -> exceptions (id,
                org_id) makes the cross-tenant row inexpressible rather than merely
                unwritten. The guard above is the clean refusal; the key is the
                guarantee that survives the next person editing this method.

            ONE METHOD, NOT A COMPOSITION. The read, the UPDATE and the INSERT are
            written inline rather than delegated to get_exception_by_id or any other
            decorated method: @auditable commits after each audit row, so composing
            transactional work out of decorated methods destroys atomicity silently
            (the w128 lesson).

            product signs off with one person. _record_accept above documents an
            'accept' as an INDEPENDENT CONCURRENCE BY A SECOND CLINICIAN, so the

            as false: the record would assert two-clinician review where one
            person acted. A distinct kind makes the record true at the level
            things query it -- an audit asking which reports had independent
            concurrence answers correctly from claim_type alone, and a site that
            later adopts two-person sign-off can see which historical reports were
            single-signed.

            PUBLIC, unlike the four spec-13.2 recorders, and the difference is not

        #     approved_at, content_hash -- together, in the one UPDATE that makes
        #     the schema's reports_approval_complete CHECK meaningful rather than
        #     merely satisfiable.
        #
        #   - No report leaves the platform without approval (spec 13.4).

            """
            Submit a draft report for review: draft -> under_review (spec 13.1).

            The workflow entry point. _approve_report accepts only 'under_review',
            so without this method no report could legitimately reach approval at
            all -- this is the transition that makes the rest of the state machine
            reachable rather than an operator writing `state` by hand.

            Three preconditions, each refusing rather than silently proceeding:

            1. THE INTERPRETER ROLE, on the session invoking this. Reading a draft
            and adding the clinical interpretation is the Interpreter's work, so
            declaring that work finished is theirs. The Approver role is
            deliberately not accepted as a substitute: approving is the
            downstream check on this submission, and letting one identity do
            both without holding both roles would collapse the two-person
            control spec 13.3 rests on.

            Unlike _approve_report, this method takes no separate actor_id and
            so needs no second per-actor role check: there is no identity
            recorded here for anything downstream to read as an authority
            claim. The session gate is the whole of it.

            2. THE REPORT IS IN 'draft'. Any other state is refused with the state
            it actually found named in the message -- including 'under_review'
            itself, so a double submission is a refusal rather than a silent
            no-op that would leave a caller believing it had just submitted.

            3. AT LEAST ONE REVIEWER CLAIM AGAINST THIS REPORT.
            This is the substantive one. Zero claims means no review happened,
            and submitting then would put raw engine output into the approval
            queue with a human's submission standing behind it.

            Checked against THIS REPORT, not against its interpretation (R9,
            human ruling 2026-09-13: a report carries its own claims and only
            its own). The difference is the whole amendment case. An amendment
            is a second report on the same interpretation, so an
            interpretation-scoped check would let an amendment be submitted on
            the strength of the ORIGINAL's review -- the original's reviewer
            would stand behind a document they never read, which is the
            failure this precondition exists to prevent, arriving by the one
            route the old check could not see.

            This precondition is what makes the explicit 'accept' claim
            load-bearing rather than ceremonial. A reviewer who agrees with
            every call still leaves rows, so "I read it and concurred" and "I
            never looked" stop being indistinguishable in the record -- which
            is the whole reason spec 13.2 made accept an action rather than the
            absence of one.

            Writes nothing but `state`. approver_id, approved_at and content_hash
            stay NULL: submission is not approval, and the schema's
            reports_approval_complete CHECK holds precisely because this method
            does not touch them.

            KEYED ON THE REPORT, NOT THE INTERPRETATION (R9 defect (b), human
            ruling 2026-09-13). It took interpretation_id and hashed every claim
            on the interpretation. An amendment is a second report row on the
            same interpretation, so the first claim recorded for an amendment
            landed inside the ORIGINAL report's recomputed hash and
            verify_report_integrity() reported the original as tampered with.
            Nothing had been tampered with, and a false alarm on an integrity
            check teaches people to ignore integrity checks.

            The rejected alternative was a cutoff at reports.approved_at, which
            needed no schema change. It was refused because it trades a false
            alarm for a real blind spot: a claim injected after approval is
            exactly what this hash exists to catch, and a timestamp cutoff
            cannot tell that injection apart from an amendment's first
            legitimate claim. See reviewer_claims.report_id's schema comment.

            run_document is still read through the report, so an amendment and
            its original -- which share an interpretation -- hash the same
            document and differ only where they genuinely differ: their claims.

            Shared by _approve_report (which writes the result) and
            verify_report_integrity (which recomputes it later and compares) so
            "the same canonicalisation" is a structural fact -- one function --
            rather than a discipline of keeping two call sites in sync by hand.

            WHY REVIEWER_CLAIMS ARE IN THIS HASH (this reverses an earlier
            decision; the correction is recorded here on purpose rather than
            silently, because the original reasoning was sound on its own terms
            and the distinction that overturns it is easy to lose again).

            The earlier version of this method excluded reviewer_claims because
            spec 13.2 leaves WHICH CLAIMS A RELEASED REPORT DISPLAYS, and how, as
            an explicitly undecided expert-branch question (see the six points
            in reviewer_claims's own schema comment) -- and hashing claims felt
            like fixing that undecided rendering into an immutability check
            before the branch was resolved.

            That reasoning conflates two different questions. Which claims are
            DISPLAYED is rendering, and the expert branch governs exactly that.
            Which claims EXISTED AT APPROVAL is a fact about what was approved,
            settled the moment the Approver signs, regardless of how any claim
            is later shown or on any surface. This hash captures the second
            question, not the first: rendering can still be decided freely, on
            its own timeline, without touching what this function computes.

            The cost of getting this wrong was asymmetric. Excluding claims left
            a real gap: a reviewer_claims row could be altered after approval
            (reviewer_claims is append-only against the application's own
            clinical_app role -- see schema.sql's grants -- but is not immune to
            a direct database write outside that role, which is exactly the
            threat a content hash exists to catch) and verify_report_integrity
            would report no tampering, because the one thing a human actually
            contributed to the approved record was the one thing not covered.
            Including claims that turn out to be irrelevant to some future
            rendering decision costs nothing verify_report_integrity cares
            about; excluding claims that turn out to matter costs the entire
            guarantee this function exists to provide.

            FIELDS HASHED PER CLAIM: EVERY stored column of a reviewer_claims
            row -- claim_type, variant_key, classification, reason, actor_id,
            timestamp, evidence_json, supersedes. There is no exclusion list.

            This is a second, later correction, and it is recorded here for the
            same reason the first one is: the two columns first left out were
            left out for reasons that looked sound in isolation and were wrong
            for the identical structural reason the original run_document-only
            scope was wrong.

            - evidence_json was excluded as "always NULL today, pending the
                expert-branch decision on what shape evidence takes." That is
                true today and is exactly the shape of the claims-exclusion bug
                this function already corrects once: a column that is empty NOW
                is not evidence it will stay empty, and evidence_json is
                precisely the column a re-derive reading of the expert branch
                would start writing into. Excluding it means the hash would
                silently stop covering reviewer evidence the moment that branch
                is decided, with nothing forcing this function to be revisited
                when it happens.
            - supersedes was excluded as "already covered where it matters,
                since a superseding claim is itself a row this function hashes."
                That covers a superseding claim being ADDED after the fact (a
                new row, which does change the hash), but not an EXISTING
                claim's supersedes value being altered in place to point
                somewhere else -- reviewer_claims is append-only against
                clinical_app, which makes that mutation unlikely, not
                impossible, and a hash that carries an exception for "the
                columns append-only makes unlikely" has an exception to explain
                every time someone reads it.

            The rule now, and the reason there is no numbered list of hashed
            columns to maintain: this function hashes every stored column of a
            reviewer_claims row. A column added to the schema later is hashed
            the day it exists, without this function needing to be revisited to
            remember to include it.

            Claims are ordered by (timestamp, id) for a stable serialisation --
            without a fixed order, two computations over the identical set of
            rows could serialise to different JSON and hash to different values,
            which would make this function non-deterministic over data that
            never changed. id is the reviewer_claims primary key, so (timestamp,
            id) is a genuine total order: id alone can never tie.

            - the identity recorded as approver -- `actor_id` -- is separately
                checked to hold the Approver role itself.

            The second check is not redundant with the first. Every other method
            in this file that takes a session plus a separate actor_id (the
            reviewer-claim recorders above, create_or_reopen_exception) lets the
            two diverge with no per-actor check, because nothing downstream reads
            actor_id as an authority claim. Here it is one: ISO 15189 7.4.1.5 c)
            requires the identity of the person who approved be retrievable, and
            a session gate alone would let any Approver's session record an
            unqualified colleague's user_id as having approved -- retrievable,
            but false. Checking actor_id's own roles closes that gap.

            Record one delivery of an approved report to one consumer.

            Release is an event, not a state flag (schema comment on
            release_events): releasing the same report to a second consumer
            inserts a second row rather than being refused by an already-released
            report. reports.state still moves to 'released', but only on the
            FIRST release -- it is a derived summary ("has this report been
            released at all"), not itself the record of who received what and
            when.

            content_hash is copied from reports.content_hash rather than
            recomputed: between approval and release nothing in this schema can
            change an interpretation's run_document (there is no UPDATE path for
            interpretations), so the value approved is definitionally the value
            being handed to this consumer. The duplication onto release_events is
            still deliberate, per that table's own schema comment -- it lets a
            reader learn what was delivered without joining back to reports.

            AUTHORITY (w129 phase B). Release is gated exactly the way approval is
            gated, twice over and for the same reason:

            - `_require_role(session, 'Approver')` gates the SESSION.
            - the identity recorded in `release_events.released_by` -- actor_id
                -- is separately checked to hold Approver itself.

            Before w129 this method checked only that actor_id named a user IN
            THIS ORGANISATION: membership, not authority. That is the identity
            half of the `_approve_report` pattern with the authority half missing,
            and it meant a session holding only Auditor -- a read-only role by
            intent -- could hand an approved report to an arbitrary named consumer
            and record any colleague as having released it. `released_by` is read
            as an authority claim the same way `reports.approver_id` is, so it
            gets the same check; see `_approve_report`'s docstring for the full
            argument, which this method now shares rather than restates.

            Approver, not a new Releaser role: the ruling of 2026-09-14 gives
            Approver "review/approval", release acts only on an already-approved
            report, and inventing an eighth role for one operation would be the
            broad RBAC redesign the same ruling forbids.

        #
        # WRITTEN FRESH, NOT LIFTED, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE WAVE'S OWN
        # QUESTION. Migration `0003` lifted DDL from the held branch
        # `w122-retraction` (a4907d3) MECHANICALLY, under an approved schema
        # decision, and its header says so at length. No decision approved
        # importing that branch's APPLICATION code, and application code is more
        # decision-laden than DDL: a4907d3 predates the w129 phase-B authority
        # rework, the `REPORT_NOT_FOUND` constant, the patient `is_retracted`
        # projection this tip already carries, and the whole administrative
        # surface. The held branch was READ (`git show`, never merged, never
        # modified) and is cited below where it CORROBORATES a ruling. Where the
        # shape below matches it, that is because the schema and the recorded
        # rulings force the shape, not because bytes were copied -- and it is
        # said here rather than left for a reader to wonder about.
        #
        # WHAT THE SCHEMA ALREADY DECIDED, so that nothing below is a fresh
        # invention. Every one of these is in THIS tree, in
        # `clinical/migrations/0003_report_retraction.sql` and `clinical/schema.sql`:
        #
        #   E1  `retracted_from_state TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (... IN ('approved',
        #       'released'))` -- which states may be retracted, AND that the row
        #       records which. The precondition below is the CHECK, moved earlier
        #       so the caller gets a sentence instead of an integrity error.
        #   E4  `replacement_report_id UUID` (nullable) plus
        #       `retraction_replacement_is_not_itself` -- a replacement is
        #       optional and may not be the report itself.
        #   E5  "retraction is NOT reversible in this wave and no reversal is
        #       built" -- so there is no `withdraw_retraction` here, and a second
        #       retraction of the same report is refused rather than appended.
        #   E6  `retraction_notifications`, `status CHECK (status =
        #       'notification_owed')`, `UNIQUE (org_id, retraction_id, consumer)`
        #       -- one DEBT per distinct consumer, never a transmission, and it
        #       does not block the retraction.
        #   E7/E3 (`data_access.py` above, lines ~3020-3350) -- a retraction
        #       FLAGS and never FILTERS; the patient surfaces return the single
        #       boolean `is_retracted` and nothing else.
        #   E8  cascade-tombstone with the report; no retention change. Nothing
        #       below touches the retention clock.
        #
        # THE ONE QUESTION THE TREE DOES NOT RECORD, AND HOW IT IS ANSWERED
        # WITHOUT INVENTING A WORKFLOW ENGINE. Which role may retract. This tree
        # names rulings E1 and E3-E8 but not E2. It is NOT left open, and it is
        # not guessed either: the DECISION RULE in force is "the smallest
        # architecture-consistent choice; preserve existing patterns". Every
        # existing verb that acts on an APPROVED report in this file is gated on
        # Approver and on nothing else -- `_approve_report`, `_release_report`,
        # `require_release` and `create_amendment`, all four measured by SYNTAX
        # TREE rather than by eye, and no line numbers are quoted here because a
        # line number in a comment is a claim that rots on the next insertion. A
        # retraction acts on an approved-or-released report, so it takes the same
        # gate. Inventing an eighth role for one operation is what
        # `_release_report`'s own docstring already refused to do, citing the
        # ruling of 2026-09-14. The held branch records this as human ruling E2 --
        # "any Approver in the org may retract; no new role" -- which is
        # CORROBORATION that the human already ruled it, not the authority for it.
        # If the human wants a different gate, this is the one line to change.

            `report_retractions`, plus one notification debt per prior recipient
            (E6), AND NOT ONE UPDATE ANYWHERE.

            THE APPROVED `reports` ROW IS NOT TOUCHED, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN,
            not an omission. A report approved on 1 March and retracted on 5
            April WAS approved: `state`, `approver_id`, `approved_at` and
            `content_hash` still say exactly what they said,
            `signing_identity_for_report` still retrieves the approver (ISO 15189
            7.4.1.5 c)) after retraction as well as before, and
            `verify_report_integrity` still returns True -- because retraction
            says "do not act on this", not "this is not what was approved". A
            sixth `reports.state` value would have made the record deny an
            approval that happened, and the database forbids it anyway
            (`enforce_content_immutability`).

            PRECONDITIONS, each one traceable to something already in this tree:
            - THE ROLE GATE IS THE FIRST STATEMENT. Approver, per the note
                above this method. It runs before the report is looked up, so an
                unauthorised caller's refusal cannot vary with whether the
                identifier names anything -- the same ordering rule the
                administrative surface's `_target` was rewritten to preserve.
            - E1: the report is 'approved' or 'released', and the row records
                WHICH in `retracted_from_state`. A draft, under_review or
                returned report has no standing to withdraw.
            - `reason` is required and non-empty (the schema says NOT NULL; an
                empty string would satisfy the column and say nothing).
            - E5: a report already retracted is REFUSED rather than retracted
                twice. Not a reversal question -- E5 rules retraction
                irreversible and none is built here -- but a reader question:
                two retraction rows for one report cannot both be stated, so a
                reader would have to pick, and picking is guessing.
            - E4: `replacement_report_id` is OPTIONAL. A report issued against
                the wrong patient's sample has nothing to replace it with. When
                supplied it must name a report IN THIS ORGANISATION, resolved
                through the session's own `org_id`; a cross-organisation
                replacement is refused here AND is structurally impossible,
                because `fk_retraction_replacement` is composite.

            WHAT THE PATIENT SEES, WHICH IS WHY THIS METHOD CHANGES NO READER.
            The patient surfaces already project `is_retracted` as a scalar
            EXISTS sub-select bound on both `org_id` and the patient's own
            report (w148, human decisions 1 and 2). This method makes those rows
            real; it does not touch them. The reason, the retractor, the
            timestamp, the from-state and the replacement identifier are all
            written here and NONE of them reaches a patient surface.

            THE AUDIT ROW NAMES THE REPORT (`resource_id_param="report_id"`) and
            carries the retraction id in `details`. An audit entry about a report
            that named a retraction id as its resource would be the w120 defect
            in a new costume.

            Create an amendment: a new report referencing an existing approved
            report, with the reason recorded and traceability to what it
            replaces maintained by a forward pointer, not a mutated column.

            Spec 15.2 requires (GEPER's own rule -- see GEPER_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_SPEC.md
            #15.2; implements ISO 15189 7.4.1.8 b)/d), the wording below is ours, not
            the standard's):
            - The original report is never modified, never withdrawn from the record
            - Traceability to the original is maintained
            - Ordering clinician is notified

            This method writes three rows and nothing else: a new `reports` row
            (the amendment itself, draft state), one `amendments` row, and one
            `amendment_notifications` row. No UPDATE anywhere -- amendments and
            amendment_notifications are append-only against clinical_app (see
            schema.sql's grants), and this method does not attempt to be the
            exception. "Current amendment" is derived by query (the row named
            in `supersedes_amendment_id` by no other row), not stored as a
            boolean column that a later write would have to keep in sync.

            Delivery mechanism for the notification (email, SMS, etc.) is
            deferred to a later phase; this records the event itself, not the
            transport. Recorded as sent (read=FALSE: may not be read yet, but
            the fact of the notification is recorded).

            Preconditions:
            - Session holds Approver (w129 phase B; see below)
            - Original report must exist in this org
            - Original report must be approved or released (not in draft/under_review/returned)
            - Reason for amendment is NOT NULL

            A second (or later) amendment of the same original chains off the
            current one: this method looks up whatever amendment of
            `original_report_id` nothing yet supersedes and records the new
            row's `supersedes_amendment_id` as that id, exactly the way
            reviewer_claims.supersedes chains. NULL means this is the first
            amendment of this original.

            AUTHORITY (w129 phase B). The session must hold Approver. An
            amendment is the one sanctioned corrective act on a record that has
            ALREADY BEEN SIGNED -- this method refuses any original that is not
            approved or released -- so its authority is the authority that signed
            it. Before w129 it checked neither the session's roles nor anything
            about the actor at all, so any authenticated session in the
            organisation could open an amendment against a colleague's approved
            report and notify the ordering clinician of it.

            Only the session is checked, not a second recorded actor: unlike
            `_approve_report` and `_release_report`, this method takes no
            actor_id. `reports.created_by` on the amendment is written from
            session.user_id, which the session gate has already qualified. The
            amendment it creates is a DRAFT, and must still pass
            `submit_for_review` (Interpreter) and `_approve_report` (Approver on
            both session and recorded actor) before it can itself be released, so
            the signing authority on the amended content is checked there, where
            the signature is actually recorded.

            Append one `fastq_sets` row for a sample IN THIS ORGANISATION.

            "deliberately indistinguishable from does not exist at all". ANOTHER
            ORGANISATION'S SAMPLE MUST BE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM UNKNOWN, not
            merely refused -- a distinct error for "exists but not yours" tells the
            caller which sample ids exist elsewhere. So the resolution below
            filters on org_id and the caller cannot tell the two cases apart.

            w129c: IT TAKES A SESSION AND THE SESSION MUST HOLD `System`.

            This paragraph used to read "No `session` argument: a scheduled scan
            has no logged-in user", and reached for the PROVISIONING audit path
            (org_id off the bound parameters, actor null). That was DRIFT, not
            architecture. "No logged-in user" is precisely the condition the System
            principal exists to answer -- `record_pipeline_result` in this same
            file already has the shape: it takes a `Session` and the worker mints
            it. Two precedents were available and the provisioning one was picked
            in passing, never argued. Three things were wrong as a result: the
            organisation was a caller-supplied CLAIM rather than a property of an
            authenticated principal; every detection was audited with a NULL
            ACTOR; and this was the only `requires_session=False` method in the
            file that writes a tenant-scoped row -- a category of one.

            THE ROLE GATE IS `System`, NOT `Lab technician`. Detection is the
            platform observing a directory, not a member of laboratory staff
            receiving a specimen, and w129 forbids treating an internal principal
            as a normal human staff role. A human session holding Administrator,
            Interpreter, Orderer AND Lab technician is refused here.

            THE SESSION COMES FROM THE CALLER. Neither this method nor
            `clinical/ingestion.py` mints one. `_create_system_session` is an
            authentication bypass whose invariant is about WHERE, not how many:
            every call site sits in a background worker class in `geper/api/`.
            Minting one in the scanner would be a FIFTH site in a non-worker module
            and test_identity.py's
            `test_create_system_session_call_sites_are_the_four_pinned_worker_sites`
            would fail -- correctly. The not-yet-written scheduler is the thing
            that has to be explicit about which principal it runs as.

            The audit row still comes from `@auditable` and only from it: an
            earlier draft called `self._audit` by hand as well and would have
            written TWO rows per detection.
