──────────────────────────────────────────────
w138 — the patient portal HTTP surface. Wave 4's three confirmed COVERAGE
findings, proved behaviourally at the routes.

NOTHING IN THIS FILE FIXES A DEFECT, AND THAT IS STATED FIRST SO THE FILE IS
NOT READ AS SOMETHING IT IS NOT. Every refusal asserted below is already
correct at `a931869`. What was missing is the assertion that HOLDS it there --
and Rule 8 is explicit that the holding form is a SET OF SIZE ONE over both
channels, because "a per-case equality passes against a leak in a case nobody
listed". Three cases were not listed:

  1. TWO OF `patient_login`'s SIX FAILURE REASONS. Counted from the method's
     own source: unknown_organisation, organisation_disabled,
     unknown_patient_login, locked_out, invalid_password,
     patient_login_disabled. `test_w132_login_refusal_parity.py::_login_probes`
     drives FOUR of them through `/portal/login` under a docstring claiming
     "all six", and the two it misses -- `locked_out` and
     `patient_login_disabled` -- are exactly the two that separate an
     UNAUTHORISED patient from a NONEXISTENT one. Its staff half carries both
     of its equivalents; the asymmetry is patient-only. The docstring is
     corrected in the same commit.
     TestTheLoginRefusalIsOneAnswerOverAllSixReasons is that half, and the
     list of six is DERIVED FROM THE SOURCE rather than typed out, so a
     seventh reason added later fails a row here instead of being missed.

  2. AN EXPIRED PATIENT SESSION, AT ANY ROUTE, OF EITHER KIND. COUNTED across
     clinical/tests at a931869: the only patient-session expiry row anywhere is
     test_patient_identity.py::test_the_idle_window_expires_at_exactly_the_
     timeout, which calls the METHOD. Absolute expiry of a patient session is
     asserted at no layer at all. Wave 4 names "expired/terminated session";
     terminated is covered twice (logout, revocation) and expired nowhere.
     THE HAZARD IS A STATUS-CHANNEL ONE AND IT IS ONE WORD WIDE: all three
     expiry conditions raise `SessionExpired`, and `_get_patient_session`
     catches `AuthenticationError`. If `SessionExpired` ever stops inheriting
     from it, an expired session answers 500 where an unknown one answers 401
     -- an oracle confirming that an id names a real, once-valid session.
     TestAnExpiredPatientSessionIsRefusedAtEveryPortalRoute is that half.

  3. THE SET RAN OVER ONE ROUTE. Both existing set-of-size-one rows
     (test_w137_patient_backend.py:316, test_portal_endpoints_http.py:271)
     collect over `GET /portal/me` alone. The three authenticated handlers do
     NOT catch identically in source -- get_my_record catches (NotFoundError,
     AuthorizationError), list_my_tests and patient_logout catch
     AuthorizationError only -- so an oracle introduced on /portal/me/tests or
     /portal/logout is in no set at this SHA.
     TestEveryPortalRefusalIsOnePairOnEveryRoute is that half.

RULE 2a -- THE ROUTE, NOT A RAW QUERY. Every refusal and every success below is
observed at a real route through `TestClient`. Direct SQL appears only where a
FIXTURE must reach a state the clock cannot be asked for (a session past its
window); no assertion reads the database. The distinction is the Phase 5d
cannot-fail-test incident: a test that builds its expectation from a SELECT
passes while the code that answers the caller is broken.

RULE 4 -- EVERY ABSENCE HAS A POSITIVE TWIN. Each refusal class below is
satisfied completely by a portal that refuses everything, and each lockout and
expiry row is satisfied completely by an implementation that locked or expired
the whole organisation. The twins are named `test_the_positive_twin_*`, they
assert on CONTENT (the right patient's own id and name, not a bare 200), and
each one's docstring names the wrong version it exists to catch. NEITHER HALF
OF A PAIR MAY BE DELETED WITHOUT THE OTHER.

WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DID NOT TEST AT a931869, because none of it existed
there and inventing it is what the queue forbids: a patient report route
(`reports` has no content column), a patient status field (`orders.state` has
seven values and three have no writer anywhere), patient trends (held on
w127-trends), and any administrative route.

TWO OF THOSE FOUR HAVE SINCE BEEN ANSWERED, AND THE PARAGRAPH IS CORRECTED
RATHER THAN LEFT STANDING (Rule 3: fix the claim, not the code) -- because this
is a file an implementer reads to learn what the portal surface is, and a stale
"there is no report route" is how one gets written twice.

  * w134 answered the STATUS question without widening the surface: the
    `stages` list is a DERIVED field on an existing response body, and
    `orders.state` is still returned nowhere.
  * w135 answered the REPORT question by widening it, to
    `GET /portal/me/reports` and `GET /portal/me/reports/{report_id}`. THE
    PARENTHESIS ABOVE IS STILL TRUE AND IS THE REASON THOSE ROUTES ARE SAFE:
    `reports` still has no content column, so what they carry is metadata and
    release state. Both are in AUTHENTICATED_PORTAL_ROUTES below and so are in
    this file's set of size one; their own behavioural rows are in
    test_w135_patient_report_access.py.

Patient trends and administrative routes remain absent, and both are still
asserted to be absent below.
