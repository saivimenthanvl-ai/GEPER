SQLite-backed store for GEPER interpretation submissions.

Marks submissions interrupted at startup if worker crashed mid-execution.
Persists on all paths (queued, running, complete, failed).

        HERE, inside the same connection and transaction as the existence
        check and the INSERT, so it cannot disagree with what was actually
        written; recomputing it in the caller with a second SELECT would race
        two identical POSTs against each other.
