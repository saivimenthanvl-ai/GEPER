Generic, standards-adjacent LIMS/LIMS-adjacent export.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT ISN'T FHIR (yet) -- read before "fixing"
this by bolting on FHIR resources
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a genuinely separate export step (not baked into
`report/report_generator.py`/`report/summary.py`) because GEPER has no
real target hospital/LIMS spec to build against yet -- per the task
this module was built for, a pilot customer's actual format is still
unknown. Two options were considered:

  1. HL7 FHIR Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide (Observation/
     DiagnosticReport/MolecularSequence profiles).
  2. A plain, clearly-documented structured export (JSON + flattened
     CSV).

Researched (live, this session -- not assumed from training data) before
choosing:
  - The IG is at STU3 (v3.0.0, published 2024-12-12) -- "Standard for
    Trial Use", NOT Normative. Version 4.0.0 is already an active
    ci-build, meaning the spec itself is still moving.
  - The IG's own home page states plainly: "The Clinical Genomics
    Working Group understands that this guide is not complete, and
    implementers might identify additional concepts and data
    elements." This is not a stable target to build a one-shot mapping
    against.
  - Real-world adoption found: eMERGE and CSER (large US federally-
    funded research consortia), the "Sync for Genes" pilot program,
    and Molit (one small German non-profit, ~2 years in production).
    No evidence found of adoption by commercial/community diagnostic
    labs generally, and NONE found for India specifically -- this
    product's actual target market (see `report/summary.py`'s own
    DPDP Act framing).
  - Implementing it properly means LOINC codes for every genomic
    Observation type, HGVS-validated Coding elements, SNOMED CT terms,
    ClinVar/ClinGen CodeableConcepts, and nested Observation.component
    hierarchies across Variant/Genotype/DiagnosticImplication/
    MolecularConsequence profiles -- real engineering investment spent
    validating against a spec with no real target implementer to
    confirm it against.

Decision: option 2. A plain, exhaustively-documented export (this
module + `LIMS_EXPORT_MAPPING.md`) that is universally ingestable
(every LIMS can parse JSON/CSV; not every LIMS has FHIR tooling) and
uses standards-adjacent values wherever GEPER already produces them
for free (ISO 8601 timestamps, real HGVS nomenclature, verbatim
ACMG/AMP 2015 classification terms, real external accessions) so a
future FHIR crosswalk -- once a real target spec exists -- is a
mapping exercise against `LIMS_EXPORT_MAPPING.md`'s table, not a
rewrite of this module.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Never invents a value for a field GEPER didn't actually determine:
  every field below traces to a real key in `geper_results.json`
  (see `LIMS_EXPORT_MAPPING.md`) or is `None` -- the same honest-gap
  discipline as `pipeline/stage_schemas.py`'s NOT_RUN/ERROR/NOT_FOUND/
  FOUND distinction.
- Never re-runs the pipeline or re-derives evidence: this reads an
  already-written `geper_results.json` (or an equivalent in-memory
  document) and reshapes it. `build_lims_export()` takes the parsed
  JSON document directly, so it can be run standalone against an
  existing output file (see this module's `__main__` CLI) without any
  GEPER pipeline dependency at import time beyond `pydantic` (already
  a GEPER requirement -- see `pipeline/stage_schemas.py`, the same
  validation-at-a-boundary pattern this module follows).
- Does not carry three fields that exist in `geper_results.json` and
  reach every other renderer -- run-level QC metrics, patient consent,
  and per-variant `clinical_report` limitations -- by design, not
  oversight: see `LIMS_EXPORT_MAPPING.md`'s "Documented design
  boundaries" section for the rationale and the per-field nuances
  (consent's regulatory caveat; why per-variant limitations is the
  mildest of the three).

    Governance gate (round 30 part 2): refuses to build a LIMS export
    unless `document["review_status"] == "reviewed"` (see
    `report/json_builder.py`/`review/signoff.py`). A LIMS is an
    automated downstream consumer -- nobody opens the PDF a human
    clinician would see the DRAFT/OVERRIDDEN status on before this
    data reaches a hospital's own system, so this must be a hard,
    loud failure here, not a silent pass-through.

    `"overridden"` is deliberately NOT treated as good enough --
    export requires review_status to be EXACTLY `"reviewed"`, so a run
    a clinician has changed since it was last (or ever) approved stays
    blocked until a fresh `review/signoff.py::approve()` call. See
    `override()`'s docstring in that module for why this is the
    correct, intended re-block, not an oversight.

    Delegates to `review/signoff.py::require_reviewed` (2026-08-22) --
    the general form of this exact check, extracted so any future
    automated consumer besides this one has it too. Catches that
    function's `SignoffError` and re-raises `LIMSExportBlockedError`
    with the same message, preserving this module's existing public
    exception contract (`tests/test_export_lims.py` and
    `tests/test_review_status_governance.py` both catch
    `LIMSExportBlockedError` specifically).

    Raises `LIMSExportBlockedError` (never returns a value) -- callers
    with a directory to log to should catch this, write an audit entry
    via `_append_export_audit_log`, then re-raise (see
    `export_lims_json`/`export_lims_csv` below), so a blocked attempt

    this against an existing output file without re-running the

    `run_id`: same optional override `report/summary.py::generate_pdf`

    authoritative run/accession ID; falls back to the same derivation
    `_derive_run_id` already uses for the PDF report, so the two stay
    consistent when both are generated from the same document.

    Raises `LIMSExportBlockedError` (round 30 part 2) if `document`

    of the mapping below runs, so this function stays a genuine single
