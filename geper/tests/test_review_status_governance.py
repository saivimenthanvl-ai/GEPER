"""
Round 30 part 2: review-status governance controls end to end --
`report/json_builder.py`'s `review_status` field,
`review/signoff.py::approve()`/`override()` actually writing it into
`geper_results.json`, `report/export_lims.py`'s hard export gate, and
`report/report_generator.py`'s Markdown banner.

Reuses `tests/test_signoff.py`'s own synthetic 3-variant fixture
(`_make_document`/`_write_run`) rather than a second hand-rolled one --
same reasoning that module's own docstring already gives for using
`build_clinical_report()` output instead of a partial dict: this
exercises the real `approve()`/`override()` code paths against a
document shaped exactly like what those functions actually read.

No model weights, no network, no `pipeline.orchestrator` import.
