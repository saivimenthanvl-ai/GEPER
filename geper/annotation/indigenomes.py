"""
IndiGenomes population-frequency evidence -- a live query integration
against CSIR-IGIB's public IndiGenomes resource
(https://clingen.igib.res.in/indigen/), built from over 1000 Indian
genomes (Jain A. et al. 2020, "IndiGenomes: a comprehensive resource
of genetic variants from over 1000 Indian genomes", Nucleic Acids
Research, doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa923, PMID 33095885). The resource's own
UI states it "is intended for purely research purposes" -- noted here
as a citation of the source's own disclaimer, not a GEPER compliance
claim.

Design note -- why this is a live query, not a downloaded local index
=======================================================================
The original design for this integration assumed IndiGenomes ships a
downloadable, per-variant allele-frequency file, the same way gnomAD
publishes bgzip'd, tabix-indexed site VCFs (see
`pipeline/gnomad/provider.py::LocalIndexedGnomadProvider`). That
assumption was checked against the live site before any code was
written, and turned out to be false in two independent ways:

  1. The one bulk file the site does publish
     ("Download Indigen Alu final geno10 all 22K vcf file" is a
     different, Alu-specific dataset; the actual whole-genome file is
     linked from the plain "Download" button:
     https://clingen.igib.res.in/indigen/download/IndiGenomes_Variants.vcf.gz,
     confirmed live 2026-08-06: HTTP 200, ~137MB, `Content-Type:
     application/x-gzip`) is **plain gzip, not BGZF** (its magic bytes
     are `1f 8b 08 08`, not BGZF's `1f 8b 08 04` + "BC" extra field),
     so it isn't directly tabix-indexable either way. More importantly,
     its records carry only `VRT=` (variant type); there is no AC/AF/AN
     INFO field anywhere in it. There is nothing to index for a
     frequency lookup.
  2. The only place IndiGenomes actually exposes AC/AF/AN is a
     per-variant JSON search endpoint its own AngularJS frontend calls
     (`POST https://clingen.igib.res.in/indigen/data.php`, request body
     `{"Name": "<chrN-POS-REF-ALT | chrN:POS:REF:ALT | rsID | gene>"}`)
     -- confirmed live against several known variants, INCLUDING a
     deliberately non-exonic/intergenic position (chr1-10190-C-A) to
     verify genome-wide, not just coding-region, coverage. Each hit's
     `"Info"` field carries the cohort's own site-level
     `AC=..;AF=..;AN=..;...` string (e.g.
     `"AC=1;AF=0.000;AN=2048;DP=26929;..."` for a real MVK missense
     variant) -- this is the actual, and only, source of IndiGenomes
     allele-frequency evidence.

So this module queries that live endpoint directly, per variant --
the same "query a live API, retry/backoff/timeout, never raise"
contract `pipeline/gnomad/provider.py::GraphQLGnomadProvider` already
established for gnomAD's own API fallback, just without a local-index
option, since IndiGenomes never publishes one usable for this purpose.
An in-process cache (`_CACHE`, in-memory only -- no disk tier, unlike
`pipeline/gnomad/cache.py::GnomadCache`) avoids re-querying the same
variant twice within one run; this is a small public research server,
not a production API with its own caching/CDN, and deserves to be
treated politely.

GRCh38 only: IndiGenomes' own VCF header declares
`##reference=GCF_000001405.39` (GRCh38.p13) with no GRCh37/hg19
release ever published. `IndiGenomesLookup.query_variant` refuses to
query a run resolved to GRCh37 rather than risk a coordinate collision
against the wrong build silently misreporting an allele frequency for
a genomically different position.
