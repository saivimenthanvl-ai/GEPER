──────────────────────────────
Background worker for GEPER interpretation submissions.

Polls submissions with status='queued', invokes geper/main.py via spawn_tracked
(so interpretations are killable), handles timeouts, and updates submission status.
On failure, creates exceptions in the clinical database to notify lab operators.

2026-09-08: this file used to shell out to a binary named "bij-interpret"
that has never existed anywhere in this repo (hive finding
meredith-establish-what-bij-interpret-is-the-last-missing-link). The
human ruled: geper/main.py is proven (ran end to end on 2026-09-05) and
this worker has never executed against anything real, so THE WORKER
ADAPTS TO geper/main.py'S CONTRACT, not the other way around. This
revision makes three changes, all traceable to that ruling: (1) invokes
geper/main.py directly via the running interpreter instead of a
nonexistent named binary -- geper/ has no [project.scripts] entry
anywhere (confirmed in the same finding), so there is no real console
script to point at without inventing packaging; (2) drops --sample-ref/
--consent-ref from the command line (geper/main.py's build_arg_parser(),
geper/main.py:43-203, has never accepted either) while leaving them on the
Submission object, the DB schema, and the API model untouched -- the
platform already knows which submission it started and does not need
the CLI to correlate it; (3) reads success/failure from the exit code
and the run document from disk instead of parsing a stdout JSON envelope
geper/main.py has never produced (geper/main.py:206-281 never prints to
stdout; its output is files under --output-dir plus an exit code).

2026-09-12 (D0, "build the link"): a completed run is now RECORDED as
clinical records -- sequencing run, VCF, interpretation, draft report, in
one transaction (clinical/data_access.py::record_pipeline_result) -- as the
organisation's system principal, after the Phase 5 preconditions pass, and
the submission's interpretation_id is that clinical interpretation (it was
a uuid4 naming nothing). A retry, a re-queue or a restart adopts an
existing record for the same VCF bytes and sample instead of running the
engine twice. Scope (ruling D1): runs whose patient/order/sample records
already exist; nothing in production creates those yet.

    "declares hpo_terms as a plain list -- ["HP:0000001", ...]" and cited
    GEPER_CLINICAL_PLATFORM_SPEC.md:457 for it. That was true when

    2026-09-13 and the field became an object; :457 is now section 10.2's
    build-mismatch paragraph and says nothing about hpo_terms at all.
    Ruled: the object shipping today is correct, so the false CLAIM is
    what gets fixed, not the API -- "the fix is to correct the comment,
    not to change the API to match a document that already changed."
    Nothing about the shapes this function accepts changed here.

    # on when CLINICAL_DSN was unset or the connection failed, leaving
    # data_access=None. The worker then ran normally, processed submissions,
    # and silently created no clinical exception records at all: the clinical
    # trail simply absent, with one startup log line as the only evidence.
    # The adjacent exception_retry_worker.py refused to start in exactly that
    # situation -- one failure, two opposite policies, chosen by nobody. The
    # refusing policy wins, in both files.

    # Raising the log level would not have been a fix: a warning nobody reads
    # and an error nobody reads fail identically. The control has to be that
    # the worker does not proceed.

    # api/main.py). exception_retry_worker.py has never had one, and adding a
    # bypass to only this worker would re-open the very divergence this change
    # closes. A supported no-clinical-database mode should be an explicit
    # decision applied to BOTH workers, not a flag that grows on one of them.
