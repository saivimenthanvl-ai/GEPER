───────────────
THE CLINICAL SERVICE'S APPLICATION OBJECT -- the thing that was missing.

`clinical/endpoints.py` has defined a router since before F1, and F1/F2 wired
its three routes to a real session and a request-scoped `DataAccess`. But
`include_router` appeared exactly once in the whole repository, inside
`clinical/tests/test_exception_endpoints_http.py`, where that file's own
docstring said the app was "test-local and deliberately so ... when the real
app lands, these tests should point at it instead". THIS IS THAT APP, and the
test file now points at it.

So the three routes were reachable only from a test. A router nobody mounts
is the same shape of defect as a placeholder nobody implements: every layer
looks present, and the service does not exist.

WHY THE READINESS ROUTE TOUCHES THE DATABASE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF IT
A service that boots and returns 500 on every request passes any liveness
probe. That is not hypothetical here -- it is exactly what this service would
have done before F1, when both dependencies raised `NotImplementedError`: the
process would have been up, `/healthz` would have answered 200, and every
real request would have been a 500. A readiness check that only proves the
process is alive measures something real and it is not the thing.

The precedent in this repository is the weaker kind: `kim_pipeline/api/main.py`
`/api/v1/ready` returns `{"status": "ready"}` unconditionally, touching
nothing it claims readiness for. `/readyz` here opens a connection and runs
real SQL, so an unreachable database, a missing DSN, or a database that is up
but was never bootstrapped all return 503 and name which one.

LIVENESS AND READINESS ARE KEPT APART BECAUSE THEY ANSWER TO DIFFERENT
ACTIONS. `/healthz` says "this process is running" -- if it fails, restart the
container. `/readyz` says "this service can do its job" -- if it fails, stop
sending it traffic, because restarting will not fix a database that is down.
Collapsing them means a database outage restart-loops every replica.

THE INTERACTIVE DOCUMENTATION IS OFF UNLESS SOMEBODY TURNS IT ON (w132).
FastAPI mounts `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect` and `/redoc`
by default, and nobody in this repository ever declared them -- so nobody
decided they were public. They were, and they are the largest anonymous
disclosure on the service: `/openapi.json` alone hands out every path, every
method, every response model field by field (`PortalPatientResponse` ->
patient_id, name, dob, sex), every declared status code and every handler
docstring, to a caller holding no credential.

THE DOCSTRINGS AND RESPONSE MODELS STAY IN THE CODE. What goes is the
anonymous SURFACE, not the documentation: `openapi_url=None` unmounts the
route, it does not delete a schema. Set `CLINICAL_ENABLE_DOCS=1` and all four
come back, unchanged, which is why this is a gate and not a deletion -- a
deletion invites the next developer to re-add them without the gate.

NO API-KEY LAYER, DELIBERATELY. `geper/api/main.py`'s `_require_api_key` is
the repository's ingress pattern and it is FAIL-OPEN by design: with
`GEPER_API_KEYS` unset it allows every request ("dev mode"). That is a
defensible trade for a structure-lookup API and it is the wrong default for
patient data. The clinical routes already authenticate per request through
`_get_session`, which fails CLOSED -- no session, no answer. Adding a
fail-open layer above a fail-closed one would only create a configuration in
which the outer check is off and looks on.

# through it. Its routes depend on _get_patient_session, which is a separate
# dependency reading a separate cookie and validating against a separate
# session table -- clinical.endpoints._get_session is neither imported by it
# nor widened. See clinical/portal_endpoints.py for why the alternative (one
# dependency accepting either principal) is the cheap move that silently
# destroys per-patient isolation.
app.include_router(portal_router)

# w132. The authentication surface: POST /auth/login and POST /portal/login,
# in ONE module with NO router prefix, each route declaring its full path.
# Two routes rather than one because the route is what names the principal —
# a combined endpoint could not avoid disclosing which credential store an
# address lives in, on a timing channel that no equalisation inside either
# method reaches. See clinical/auth_endpoints.py.
#
# Mounted alongside, never through: it adds no dependency to the two routers
# above, and neither of them imports it.
app.include_router(auth_router)

# w132c. `POST /auth/logout`. It is a SECOND, UNPREFIXED router out of
# clinical/endpoints.py rather than a third route in auth_endpoints.py,
# because logout is the one authentication act that CONSUMES a session
# instead of minting one — it depends on `_get_session`, which lives there,
# and `auth_endpoints.py` is pinned by a structural guard not to import
# either session dependency. `POST /portal/logout` is on `portal_router`
# above for the mirror reason: `_get_patient_session` lives in that file.
app.include_router(session_router)

# w152 (WAVE 2). THE ADMINISTRATIVE SURFACE, and it is the first one this
# service has ever had: at e1be7ab the seventeen production routes contained
# ZERO administrative ones, which is why fourteen domain capabilities were
# unreachable for the SAME reason — no route.
#
# Mounted ALONGSIDE, never through, exactly as the portal and auth routers
# are. It adds no dependency to any router above and none of them imports it.
# What it DOES import, deliberately, is `clinical.endpoints`'s `_get_session`
# and `_get_data_access`: the administrative routes authenticate with the
# SAME staff dependency as the exception routes and authorise through the
# SAME `DataAccess._require_role` inside the same domain methods. A second
# copy of either would be a second security policy, and the weaker one would
# be the one nobody reads.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS REACHABLE BY A REAL DEPLOYMENT YET. Every administrative
# route requires an Administrator or an Auditor, and no production path makes
# the first one — `assign_role` requires an existing Administrator and is the
# only human-role writer. That deadlock is Wave 3's. Until it lands these
# routes are IMPLEMENTED + UNREACHABLE and are classified that way.

    Can this SERVICE actually serve? Returns 503 when it cannot, and names
    which of the three ways it failed.

    Checked in order, because each step is meaningless without the one before:
      1. `CLINICAL_DSN` is configured at all;
      2. a connection can be opened and `SELECT 1` answered;
      3. the schema is present -- otherwise Postgres is up and this is not the
         clinical database;
      4. the schema is at the VERSION this code was written for (w126m).

    WHY STEP 4 EXISTS, AND IT IS THE WHOLE OF THIS WAVE'S PRODUCTION CHANGE.
    `_SENTINEL_TABLE` is `sessions`, and `sessions` exists in every variant of
    this schema there has ever been -- it is a baseline table no held change
    touches. So steps 1-3 answered 200 for EVERY wrong pairing of code and
    database: a service whose code names a column its database does not have
    reported healthy to Docker's HEALTHCHECK and to any orchestrator, and then
    failed the reads that column is in. Step 3 detects ABSENCE; it has never
    been able to detect a VERSION, and the two are different questions.

    Step 4 asks `clinical/migrate.py` instead, which answers from the
    migration history AND from `pg_catalog` -- so a database that is behind,
    that has never been migrated, whose migration files have been edited since
    they ran, or whose history claims an object the catalog does not have, is
    all reported NOT ready, each by its own name.

    IT DETECTS, IT DOES NOT FIX. Migrating needs privileges the entire
    GRANT/REVOKE block exists to deny `clinical_app`, and `clinical_app` is
    what this connection is. `python -m clinical.migrate` is the other half
    and it is run by an operator with the administrative DSN.

    THE 200 BODY IS UNCHANGED, deliberately: this is a probe other things
    parse, and a new field in the ready response is endpoint behaviour that
    nothing asked to change. Everything new here is a 503.
