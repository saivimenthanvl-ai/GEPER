"""
Card DEFECT-two-component-trees-each-self-identify-as-the-WHOLE-product-
under-a-ratified-combined-name -- RULED Option B, 2026-09-11.

The human's words: "...the Bij AI sequencing-analysis component (Kim)";
and for the version string: "scope it -- 'Bij AI sequencing-analysis
component v8' ... the version field must name the same thing the scope
line does."

Before this, kim's report said it was "produced by the Kim pipeline" --
the same sentence typed out twice, once in the HTML template and once in
the ReportLab PDF -- and PIPELINE_VERSION ("Bij AI v8") put the whole
product's name on every JSON, HTML and PDF report this tree emits alone.

Pinned VERBATIM (ratified clinician-facing text). Checked on RENDERED
output for the HTML and PDF, and on the SOURCE of the shipped pipeline
package for "one copy, and no old phrase survives".
