──────────────────────────────────

R9: the two clinical amendment defects, and the one root cause under both.

An amendment is a SECOND reports row on the SAME interpretation
(create_amendment). Reviewer claims used to be scoped to the interpretation
alone, so every claim on that interpretation was equally every report's
claim. Two defects followed:

  (b) THE FALSE TAMPER ALARM. _compute_report_content_hash() hashed every
      claim on the interpretation, so the FIRST claim recorded for an
      amendment changed the ORIGINAL report's recomputed hash and
      verify_report_integrity(original) returned False. Nothing had been
      tampered with. A false alarm on an integrity check teaches people to
      ignore integrity checks.

  (a) THE AMENDED REPORT WITH THE ORIGINAL'S BODY. An amendment could not
      carry reviewer claims of its own: no query could answer "this
      report's claims" at all.

Fixed by reviewer_claims.report_id (human ruling 2026-09-13), which also
resolves expert-branch decision point 4 in that table's schema comment: a
report carries its OWN claims and only its own, never the cumulative set.

Both classes below were RED against b1ceaf1 -- (b) behaviourally, with the
false alarm observed; (a) because get_reviewer_claims and the column it
reads did not exist. The controls (a genuine tamper still detected, an
unamended report unchanged) were green before and must stay green.

NOT COVERED HERE, deliberately: there is no clinical report-BODY renderer
in this codebase, and this change does not build one. These tests stop at
the data model -- "this report's claims" being answerable and correct,
which is what a renderer will need.
