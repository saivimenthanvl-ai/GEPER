"""
DNA sequence context generation.

Given a variant's chromosome/position/REF/ALT, this module fetches the
reference genomic flanking sequence (via the Ensembl REST API) and
builds both the reference-allele and alternate-allele versions of the
window, which is what every downstream DNA/RNA/protein model actually
consumes.

Ensembl REST is used (rather than requiring a local reference FASTA)
so GEPER has zero local reference-genome storage requirements and
works out of the box in Colab.
