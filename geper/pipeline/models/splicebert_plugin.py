SpliceBERT plugin -- real integration (not a placeholder).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
License verification summary (same convention as SpliceFormerPlugin/
EnformerPlugin/BorzoiPlugin -- repeated here so this file is
self-contained):

  - Official implementation: github.com/biomed-AI/SpliceBERT, the
    repository the peer-reviewed paper's own code links to (Chen et
    al., "Self-supervised learning on millions of primary RNA
    sequences from 72 vertebrates improves sequence-based RNA
    splicing prediction", Briefings in Bioinformatics 25(3), bbae163
    (2024), https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbae163).
  - Code license: BSD-3-Clause, confirmed by reading the repository's
    own `LICENSE` file directly ("BSD 3-Clause License / Copyright
    (c) 2023, Ken Chen") -- permissive, commercially usable, requires
    only copyright-notice/disclaimer preservation (no attribution-in-
    output requirement, unlike the weights below).
  - Weights license: UNLIKE SpliceFormer's Zenodo archive (where the
    CC-BY-4.0 tag is only the *deposit's* metadata license and the
    code's own MIT LICENSE governs actual use -- see
    spliceformer_plugin.py's docstring), SpliceBERT's pretrained
    weights are published ONLY on Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7995778,
    `models.tar.gz`; the GitHub repo has no weight files of its own,
    its `download.sh` just fetches this same Zenodo URL). Zenodo is
    therefore the actual, sole distribution channel for the weights,
    not merely an archival mirror of something already licensed
    elsewhere -- so that record's own declared license (confirmed via
    Zenodo's own API: `GET /api/records/7995778` ->
    `metadata.license.id == "cc-by-4.0"`) is the operative license for
    the weight files themselves. CC-BY-4.0 is commercially usable and
    redistributable, but -- unlike the BSD-3-Clause code above --
    DOES require attribution to be preserved wherever the weights (or
    predictions derived from them) are redistributed; this metadata
    (`license_notes` below, surfaced via `ModelMetadata`) IS that
    attribution, carried through to any report/audit reader exactly
    the way `ModelMetadata` is designed to be consulted.
  - Net result: both code and weights are commercially usable. No
    copyleft concern; the one real difference from SpliceFormer/
    Enformer/Borzoi's weight licenses is CC-BY-4.0's attribution
    requirement, which is why `license_notes`
    spells it out explicitly rather than reusing "MIT/Apache-2.0,
    notice-preservation only" boilerplate.

Implementation note (why this plugin looks different from
SpliceFormer's vendored-source pattern): SpliceBERT's official
checkpoints are plain HuggingFace `BertForMaskedLM` weights (confirmed
by inspecting the downloaded checkpoint's own `config.json`:
`"architectures": ["BertForMaskedLM"]`, standard `BertTokenizer`
vocab) -- no custom model-definition source exists upstream to vendor
at all. `pipeline/models/splicebert/loader.py` only fetches and
unpacks the official Zenodo archive; the model/tokenizer classes come
directly from the `transformers` package GEPER already depends on
unconditionally (requirements.txt), the same `from_pretrained(...)`
one-liner shape EnformerPlugin/BorzoiPlugin already use for their own
HuggingFace-hosted weights.

Variant-scoring method note: SpliceBERT is a masked-language-model
(MLM) encoder -- it was never given a dedicated splice-site
classification head by its authors (no fine-tuned donor/acceptor
checkpoint is published; the repo's own `examples/04-splicesite-
prediction/` folder *trains* one from labeled data, it doesn't ship
one). This plugin therefore scores a variant the same documented,
zero-shot way the official repo's own downstream analysis notebook
does (`examples/01-variant/variant_analysis.ipynb`, which computes a
`prob_change_score` = the model's masked-position probability of the
reference base minus its probability of the alternate base): mask
each position where the centered ref/alt windows differ, run one
batched forward pass, and read P(ref base) - P(alt base) from the MLM
head's own softmax at that position ("masked-marginal" scoring, the
same zero-shot variant-effect-scoring method established for protein
language models by Meier et al., "Language models enable zero-shot
prediction of the effects of mutations on protein function", NeurIPS
2021). This is a different summary statistic from SpliceFormer's own
acceptor/donor-specific delta (SpliceFormer's checkpoint IS a
dedicated donor/acceptor classifier; SpliceBERT's is not), but is
reported through the exact same `score`/`classification`/
`confidence`/`details`/`meta` shape every other plugin in this family
uses, so callers do not need to special-case it.

Ensemble/evidence-aggregation note: like SpliceFormer, this plugin is
deliberately NOT added to `pipeline/models/ensemble.py`'s
Enformer+Borzoi consensus (that ensemble feeds PP3/BP4 specifically),
and not passed to ACMG PP3/BP4 evaluation. It IS otherwise wired into
a live per-variant run, the same way SpliceFormer is: invoked from
`pipeline/orchestrator.py::_run_standalone_splice_plugin_stage`
(called at `pipeline/orchestrator.py:1465-1466`), listed in the "AI
Models" status table (`pipeline/models/status.py:306-310`), and
consumed directly by BP7 (`pipeline/acmg_rules.py::
ACMGRuleEngine._bp7`) -- whose rationale text (caveated here as
"uncalibrated; not clinically validated") reaches `report/*` through
the same `supporting_evidence`/`conflicting_evidence` mechanism every
other criterion's evidence uses. It is also reachable via
`ModelManager` (through
`pipeline.models.pending_plugins.build_default_registry()`) for
direct/programmatic use and tests, exactly like SpliceFormer.
