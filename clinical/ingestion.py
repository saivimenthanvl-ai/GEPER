"""
clinical/ingestion.py — the FASTQ scanner.

A scheduled, READ-ONLY sweep of `{GEPER_FASTQ_ROOT}/{org_id}/incoming/` that
records complete, stable, verified paired-end FASTQ sets as `fastq_sets` rows.

READ-ONLY IS THE FIRST PROPERTY, NOT A NICE ONE. This module never deletes,
moves, renames or writes a file. Sequencer output is the raw evidence behind a
clinical result; a scanner that tidies its input can destroy the only copy of
something that later needs re-examining. Everything it decides is recorded in
the database, and the tree is left exactly as it was found -- asserted by
`test_the_scanner_moves_and_deletes_nothing`, which compares names, sizes and
bytes before and after.

DETECTION ONLY. Nothing here invokes a pipeline. A `fastq_sets` row says "these
two files existed, complete and verified, at this moment" and nothing more.

WHAT IT DOES NOT OWN: org isolation, the audit trail, the exception vocabulary
and the SQL all belong to `DataAccess`, and this module calls into them rather
than reproducing them. `record_fastq_set` resolves the sample scoped to the
organisation and raises the existing `NotFoundError`; this module never issues
a query of its own. That is deliberate -- a second module writing its own
INSERTs would be a parallel mechanism, which is the divergence that costs more
than the duplication saves.

IT DOES NOT OWN ITS PRINCIPAL EITHER (w129c). `scan_org` takes the CALLER'S
`Session` and reads the organisation off it; it does not accept an `org_id`
and it does not mint a session. `_create_system_session` is an authentication
bypass confined by name to background worker classes in `geper/api/`, and this
module is not one -- so the scheduler that eventually drives a sweep is the
thing that has to be explicit about which principal it runs as. That is the
decision being pushed up rather than guessed at here.

THE FILENAME CONTRACT IS RULED, NOT CHOSEN, AND IT IS NARROW ON PURPOSE:

    {sample_id}_{tag}_R1_001.fastq.gz
    {sample_id}_{tag}_R2_001.fastq.gz

`sample_id` IS THE UUID OF A `samples` ROW -- THE PLATFORM'S OWN IDENTIFIER --
because a lab-supplied accession in a filename is a CALLER-SUPPLIED IDENTIFIER
ARRIVING WHERE THE PLATFORM'S IDENTIFIER BELONGS. That is not an analogy, it is
a defect this repository has already fixed once: `ResolutionRequest` in
`clinical/endpoints.py` used to carry an `actor` field, and whatever the caller
typed became the record of who resolved an exception. THE FIELD WAS REMOVED
RATHER THAN VALIDATED -- a validated claim is still a claim -- and the actor is
now derived from the authenticated session. WIDENING THIS PATTERN TO ACCEPT AN
ACCESSION WOULD RE-OPEN AT THE INGESTION BOUNDARY EXACTLY WHAT THAT CHANGE
CLOSED AT THE API BOUNDARY, and it would do so without the resolution step or
the column that would make an accession mean anything.

A SITE THAT CANNOT EMIT A UUID HAS A MAPPING PROBLEM, SOLVED AT THE SITE. It is
not grounds to loosen the contract, and the mapping is an anticipated
deployment artefact rather than an edge case. If ingestion ever genuinely needs
to know a lab-local id exists, that is a resolution step with a provenance
trail -- a schema conversation, not a wider pattern. Human ruling, 2026-09-08.

`tag` is whatever the sequencer put between them (`S1_L001` in Illumina output)
and is opaque here beyond having to match across the two mates. A file that
does not match is REJECTED AND NAMED rather than ignored, because a set that
silently never appears is indistinguishable from a directory nobody wrote to.
