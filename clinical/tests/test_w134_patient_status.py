w134 — patient-visible progress, and the seven values it REFUSES to invent.

WHAT THIS FILE IS ABOUT, AND IT IS TWO DIFFERENT SHAPES OF CLAIM:

  1. THE POSITIVE HALF. Every state the surface CAN emit is driven to, through
     the real writers, and read back through the real route. A state with no
     row here is a state nobody proved.

  2. THE REFUSAL HALF, and it is the half this wave exists for. COUNTED at
     0b4bcac: the workflow declares NINETEEN state values across four state
     columns; TWELVE have a writer and SEVEN have none. A status surface built
     on a writerless value reports the same thing for ever. So there are rows
     below that prove the seven are absent -- and, because Rule 4 says an
     absence assertion passes vacuously against a surface that emits nothing at
     all, every one of them is paired with a positive twin.

RULE 2a -- THE METHOD, NOT A RAW QUERY. Every progress claim is read back
through `GET /portal/me/tests` or through `DataAccess.list_my_test_orders`.
Raw SQL appears only to SET UP (the `tests` catalogue row and the role grants,
exactly as the existing fixtures do) and, in one place, to prove what the
database actually holds so that the assertion about what the ROUTE says is
about the route and not about the row. Nothing here concludes "the patient sees
X" from a SELECT.

RULE 2c -- NO SILENT TRANSITION. `orders.state` is the wrong source and is
sitting right there. TestTheWrongSourceProducesNothing drives an order to the
state where the two sources DISAGREE -- the pipeline has run, but the column
still says `sample_awaited` -- and asserts the route's body contains none of
the column's vocabulary. A later implementer folding the column in "to make the
picture complete" fails that row.

RULE 4 -- COUNTS AND ABSENCES NEED CONTENT. No row here asserts "six stages"
and stops. Each asserts the stage NAMES and the state VALUES, by content.

RULE 8 -- AN ORACLE CAN LIVE IN EITHER CHANNEL. The new field is in the
refusal set as a set of size one over `(status, content)`, with the positive
twin that a live session is not in it.

THE ISOLATION AXES ARE TESTED ON THE NEW FIELD SPECIFICALLY, not inherited:
a derived field assembled from five extra tables is exactly where an org
predicate gets dropped from one subquery and nowhere else, and the existing
w137/w138 rows read `/portal/me`, which never touches those tables.
